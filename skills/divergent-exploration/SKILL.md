# Divergent Exploration

Creative work demands divergent thinking before convergent decisions. This skill enforces structured exploration to prevent premature commitment to the first idea that seems reasonable.

## When This Skill Activates

Apply divergent exploration before:

- **Epic creation**: Explore different ways to solve the user problem
- **Architecture decisions**: Explore genuinely different approaches
- **Feature design**: Explore alternative solutions
- **Technical decomposition**: Explore different implementation strategies
- **Problem solving**: Explore root cause hypotheses

## The Three Phases

### Phase 1: Diverge
Generate 3-5 **genuinely distinct** approaches. Not variations on a theme—fundamentally different solutions.

**Red flag**: If options are "Option A", "Option A but faster", and "Option A with better UI"—you haven't diverged.

### Phase 2: Evaluate
Assess each option on: User Impact, Technical Complexity, Time to Value, Dependencies, Reversibility, Risk Profile.

### Phase 3: Converge
Present options with clear recommendations. Never decide for users on significant choices.

## The Mindset

The first idea that comes to mind is often:
1. The most conventional (not necessarily best)
2. Anchored on recent experience (may not fit this context)
3. Missing creative solutions that require more thought

By forcing yourself to generate genuine alternatives, you either:
- **Discover a better approach** you would have missed
- **Validate your instinct** with confidence it survived comparison

Both outcomes improve decision quality.
