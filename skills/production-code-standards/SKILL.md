  This skill should be used when enforcing production-grade code quality. Activate when:
  - User says: "implement", "write code", "add feature", "fix bug", "create service", "build"
  - User says: "review PR", "check this code", "is this production ready"
  - Editing files in: src/, lib/, app/, services/, modules/, controllers/
  - Using tools: Write, Edit on .ts, .js, .tsx, .jsx files

  Blocks TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, empty catch blocks, fallback logic, || default patterns,
  setTimeout for race conditions, mocked services outside tests. Enforces fail-fast error handling.

# Production Code Standards

All production code must be permanent, complete, and production-grade.

## Enforcement Workflow

1. **Before writing**: Plan the complete, permanent solution
2. **While writing**: Check against prohibited patterns
3. **When blocked**: STOP, document, create ticket - never workaround
4. **Before committing**: Verify no prohibited patterns exist

## Prohibited Patterns

| Pattern | Why Blocked |
|---------|-------------|
| `value \|\| default` | Hides errors silently |
| `TODO/FIXME/HACK` | Temporary code in production |
| `catch (e) { }` | Swallows errors |
| Mock services in src/ | Test artifacts in production |
| `setTimeout` for race conditions | Workaround, not fix |

## Required Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Fail-fast validation | Errors caught at entry |
| Typed custom errors | Debuggable, catchable |
| Error propagation | Let errors bubble to handlers |
| Repository pattern | Data access abstraction |

## When Blocked

If proper implementation is blocked:

1. **STOP** - Do not create a workaround
2. **DOCUMENT** - State what's blocking
3. **CREATE TICKET** - File ticket for the blocker
4. **WAIT** - Blocker must be fixed first

**If implementation requires a workaround, do not implement. Communicate the blocker clearly.**

See `references/anti-patterns.md` for detailed code examples of prohibited and required patterns.

See `examples/error-handling-patterns.md` for practical before/after transformations.
