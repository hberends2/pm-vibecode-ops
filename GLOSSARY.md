# Glossary: Technical Terms for Product Managers

A PM-friendly guide to technical terminology used in AI-powered development workflows.

## Quick Reference

**Most Important Terms**:
- [Epic](#epic) - A major user capability
- [Service Inventory](#service-inventory) - List of existing functionality
- [Discovery](#discovery) - Codebase analysis phase
- [Acceptance Criteria](#acceptance-criteria) - Specific requirements for completion
- [Technical Decomposition](#technical-decomposition) - Breaking features into tasks
- [PR (Pull Request)](#pr-pull-request) - Code submission for review
- [Quality Gates](#quality-gates) - Automated checks before shipping

---

## A

### Acceptance Criteria
**PM Definition**: Specific, testable conditions that must be true for a feature to be considered complete.

**Example**:
```
Feature: CSV Export
Acceptance Criteria:
- Export button visible on dashboard
- CSV includes all visible columns
- File downloads with descriptive name
```

**Why it matters**: Clear criteria prevent misunderstandings between PMs and developers. AI uses these to validate implementation.

---

### Adaptation Guide
**PM Definition**: Document mapping PRD requirements to existing codebase patterns.

**Think of it as**: Translation guide from "what you want" to "how it fits in the codebase."

**Created by**: Discovery phase
**Used by**: Implementation phase

---

### Agent
**PM Definition**: Specialized AI assistant optimized for specific tasks (e.g., frontend-engineer-agent, security-engineer-agent).

**Analogy**: Like having expert consultants for different areas—one for UI, one for security, one for backend.

**Example**:
- **frontend-engineer-agent**: Builds user interfaces
- **security-engineer-agent**: Reviews for vulnerabilities
- **qa-engineer-agent**: Creates test suites

---

### API (Application Programming Interface)
**PM Definition**: A way for different software systems to communicate with each other.

**Real-world analogy**: Like a restaurant menu—it shows what you can order (available functions) without needing to know how the kitchen works.

**Example**: Your app might use Stripe's API to process payments without building payment processing yourself.

**Why PMs care**: When writing PRDs, you might reference integrating with external APIs (Stripe, Twilio, etc.).

---

### API Key
A secret code that authenticates your access to a service. Think of it like a password for apps to talk to each other. You'll need API keys for Claude (Anthropic), Linear, and optionally Perplexity.

**Example**: `sk-ant-abc123...` (Anthropic) or `lin_api_xyz...` (Linear)

---

### Architecture
**PM Definition**: The high-level structure and organization of a software system.

**Analogy**: Like a building's blueprint—shows how major components connect.

**Example architectures**:
- **Monolithic**: Everything in one codebase (like a single building)
- **Microservices**: Separate services for different functions (like a campus)
- **Serverless**: Cloud provider manages infrastructure (like coworking space)

**Why PMs care**: Affects how quickly features can be built and how the system scales.

---

## B

### Backend
**PM Definition**: The server-side part of an application that users don't see directly.

**What it does**:
- Processes data
- Manages database
- Handles business logic
- Provides APIs for frontend

**Example**: When a user clicks "Export to CSV," the backend:
1. Fetches data from database
2. Formats it as CSV
3. Sends file to user's browser

**Opposite of**: [Frontend](#frontend)

---

### Branch (Git)
**PM Definition**: A parallel version of the code where new features are developed without affecting production.

**Analogy**: Like making edits to a Google Doc in "suggesting mode" instead of directly changing it.

**Workflow**:
1. Create branch from main codebase
2. Develop feature on branch
3. Test and review
4. Merge branch back to main when ready

**Why PMs care**: Allows multiple features to be developed simultaneously without conflicts.

---

### Build
**PM Definition**: The process of converting source code into a runnable application.

**Analogy**: Like compiling ingredients (code) into a finished meal (app).

**When it fails**: Usually means code has errors or dependencies are missing.

**PM action**: If build fails, ask developers to investigate and fix.

---

## C

### CICD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment)
**PM Definition**: Automated system that tests and deploys code changes.

**What it does**:
1. **Continuous Integration**: Automatically tests new code when submitted
2. **Continuous Deployment**: Automatically deploys passing code to production

**Benefits**:
- Catches bugs early
- Faster releases
- Consistent quality

**PM impact**: Features ship faster with less manual process.

---

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
A text-based way to interact with your computer by typing commands instead of clicking. Also called "terminal" or "shell." See [Setup Guide](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) for a beginner introduction.

**Example**: Running `claude --version` in your terminal

---

### Codebase
**PM Definition**: The complete collection of source code for a project.

**Analogy**: Like a library of all the written material for your application.

**Includes**:
- Application code
- Tests
- Configuration files
- Documentation

**Why PMs care**: This is what gets analyzed during the discovery phase.

---

### Code Review
**PM Definition**: Process where code is examined for quality, security, and best practices before merging.

**Who reviews**:
- Other developers (manual review)
- AI agents (automated review)
- Automated tools (linters, security scanners)

**What they check**:
- Does code work correctly?
- Is it maintainable?
- Does it follow team standards?
- Are there security issues?

**PM role**: Review the summary (don't read code directly)

---

### Component
**PM Definition**: Reusable piece of user interface.

**Examples**:
- Button
- Form input field
- Navigation menu
- Data table
- Modal dialog

**Analogy**: Like LEGO blocks—build complex UIs from simple, reusable pieces.

**Why it matters**: Reusing components keeps UI consistent and speeds development.

---

### CRUD
**PM Definition**: **C**reate, **R**ead, **U**pdate, **D**elete - the four basic operations for managing data.

**Real-world example** (User management):
- **Create**: Add new user
- **Read**: View user details
- **Update**: Edit user profile
- **Delete**: Remove user account

**Why PMs care**: Most basic features are CRUD operations. These are perfect for AI-powered implementation.

---

### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
**PM Definition**: Publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities in software.

**Example**: "CVE-2025-1234: SQL injection vulnerability in Package X"

**Why PMs care**: Security review checks for known CVEs in your dependencies.

**PM action**: If critical CVE found, prioritize fixing before shipping.

---

## D

### Database
**PM Definition**: System for storing and retrieving structured data.

**Types**:
- **SQL** (PostgreSQL, MySQL): Structured tables with relationships
- **NoSQL** (MongoDB): Flexible document storage

**Example**: User profiles, order history, analytics data.

**PM perspective**: Think of it as an Excel spreadsheet, but way more powerful and reliable.

---

### Dependencies
**PM Definition**: External code libraries your application relies on.

**Analogy**: Like ingredients you buy from the store instead of making from scratch.

**Examples**:
- Authentication library (Auth0, Supabase)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Email sending (SendGrid)

**Risks**:
- Security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Outdated or unmaintained packages
- License compatibility issues

**PM care**: Security review checks dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

---

### Deployment
**PM Definition**: The process of releasing code to production so users can access it.

**Stages**:
1. **Development**: Code being written
2. **Staging**: Test environment mirroring production
3. **Production**: Live environment serving real users

**PM role**: Approve deployment after reviewing quality gates.

---

### Discovery
**PM Definition**: Phase where AI analyzes the codebase to understand patterns, architecture, and existing services.

**What it produces**:
- Technology stack documentation
- Existing service inventory
- Code patterns and conventions
- Reuse opportunities

**Why it matters**: Ensures new code matches existing patterns and maximizes reuse.

**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

---

## E

### Epic
**PM Definition**: A large user capability that provides significant value and typically takes multiple sprints to complete.

**Size**: Too big to complete in one sprint, should decompose into multiple [sub-tickets](#sub-ticket)

**Example**:
```
Epic: User Profile Customization
├── Sub-ticket: Profile photo upload
├── Sub-ticket: Bio editor
├── Sub-ticket: Custom profile URL
└── Sub-ticket: Social links integration
```

**PM ownership**: PMs define epics based on user value, engineers decompose into sub-tickets.

---

### Environment Variable
A way to store configuration values (like API keys) that programs can access. Set once and all programs can use them, keeping sensitive info out of your code.

**Example**: `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."` sets the key for Claude Code

---

### Endpoint (API)
**PM Definition**: A specific URL where an application accepts requests.

**Example**:
```
GET /api/users/123       → Get user with ID 123
POST /api/users          → Create new user
PUT /api/users/123       → Update user 123
DELETE /api/users/123    → Delete user 123
```

**PM perspective**: Think of endpoints as specific actions your app can perform.

---

## F

### Framework
**PM Definition**: Pre-built foundation for building applications, providing common functionality out of the box.

**Examples**:
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular
- **Backend**: Next.js, NestJS, Django, Rails
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter

**Analogy**: Like a house frame—provides structure, you add the details.

**Why PMs care**: Framework choice affects development speed and available features.

---

### Frontend
**PM Definition**: The user-facing part of an application that runs in the browser or mobile app.

**What it includes**:
- User interface
- Interactions
- Visual design
- Client-side logic

**Example**: Everything you see and click in a web app.

**Opposite of**: [Backend](#backend)

---

## G

### Git
**PM Definition**: Version control system that tracks changes to code over time.

**What it does**:
- Saves history of all changes

- Branches allow parallel development

---

## I

### Integration
**PM Definition**: Connecting your application with external services or systems.

**Examples**:
- **Payment**: Stripe, PayPal
- **Email**: SendGrid, Mailgun
- **Authentication**: Auth0, Okta
- **Analytics**: Segment, Mixpanel

**Why PMs care**: Integrations extend functionality without building from scratch.

---

## L

### Linear / Ticketing System
**PM Definition**: Project management tool for software teams. Linear is recommended for this workflow, but Jira and other ticketing systems with MCP integration also work.

**What a ticketing system provides**:
- Issue tracking (epics, tasks, bugs)
- Project organization
- Sprint planning
- Roadmap visualization
- Automation via MCP

**Why this workflow needs MCP integration**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) allows AI agents to create and update tickets automatically. Linear and Jira both have MCP servers available.

**Alternatives**:
- **Linear** (recommended): [Linear MCP](https://github.com/QuantGeekDev/linear-mcp)
- **Jira** (supported): [Jira MCP](https://github.com/zcaceres/jira-mcp)
- **Others**: Any ticketing system with MCP integration

---

## M

### Merge
**PM Definition**: Combining code from a branch back into the main codebase.

**Process**:
1. Developer completes feature on branch
2. Creates pull request for review
3. Code passes quality gates
4. PM or tech lead approves
5. Code is merged to main
6. Branch is deleted

**PM role**: Final approval before merge (after quality gates pass).

---

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
A standard for connecting AI assistants to external services. MCP "servers" give Claude Code new capabilities—like creating Linear tickets or searching the web.

**See**: [MCP Setup Guide](docs/MCP_SETUP.md)

---

### Microservices
**PM Definition**: Architecture where application is built from small, independent services.

**Example**:
- User Service (handles user accounts)
- Order Service (processes orders)
- Payment Service (handles payments)
- Notification Service (sends emails/SMS)

**Benefits**:
- Services can be updated independently
- Easier to scale specific functionality
- Teams can work in parallel

**Drawbacks**:
- More complexity
- Harder to test end-to-end

---

## N

### npm (Node Package Manager)
A tool for installing JavaScript packages and tools. Used to install Claude Code and MCP servers. Comes bundled with Node.js.

**Example**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

---

### npx
A tool that runs npm packages without permanently installing them. Used for MCP servers that run on-demand.

**Example**: `npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear`

---

## O

### ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
**PM Definition**: Tool that lets developers work with databases using code instead of SQL queries.

**Examples**: Prisma, TypeORM, Django ORM

**Benefit**: Makes database operations safer and easier.

**PM perspective**: You don't need to understand ORMs, but they prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

### OWASP
**PM Definition**: Open Web Application Security Project - organization that publishes security best practices.

**OWASP Top 10**: Most critical web security risks:
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable Components
7. Authentication Failures
8. Data Integrity Failures
9. Logging Failures
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

**Why PMs care**: Security review checks against OWASP Top 10.

---

## P

### PR (Pull Request)
**PM Definition**: Request to merge code changes from a branch into main codebase.

**What it includes**:
- Description of changes
- Code diff (what changed)
- Test results
- Review comments

**PR lifecycle**:
1. Developer creates PR
2. Automated tests run
3. Code review (AI + human)
4. Security review
5. PM approval
6. Merge to main

**PM role**: Review PR description (not code), approve if quality gates pass.

---

### PATH
A list of directories where your computer looks for programs. If you get "command not found" errors, the program might not be in your PATH.

---

### Production
**PM Definition**: The live environment serving real users.

**Stages** (typical):
- **Development**: Where developers write code
- **Staging**: Test environment mimicking production
- **Production**: Live system users interact with

**"Shipping to production"** = Making feature available to real users

**PM perspective**: This is where your product lives and users experience features.

---

## Q

### Quality Gates
**PM Definition**: Automated checks that code must pass before shipping.

**This workflow's quality gates**:
1. **Service Inventory**: Prevent duplication
2. **Code Review**: Check quality and patterns
3. **Testing**: Achieve 90%+ coverage
4. **Security Review**: No critical vulnerabilities

**PM role**: Ensure no quality gates are skipped, review reports.

**Benefits**:
- Consistent quality
- Catch issues early
- Reduce production bugs

---

## R

### Repository (Repo)
**PM Definition**: Storage location for code, typically on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

**Contains**:
- All source code
- Version history
- Documentation
- Configuration

**Analogy**: Like a project folder in Google Drive, but with full history and collaboration features.

---

### REST API
**PM Definition**: Common style for building web APIs.

**How it works**:
- URLs represent resources (e.g., /users, /orders)
- HTTP methods indicate actions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Returns data in JSON format

**PM perspective**: When you say "build an API," this is usually what you mean.

---

## S

### Service
**PM Definition**: A module of code responsible for specific functionality.

**Examples**:
- **AuthService**: Handles login/logout
- **EmailService**: Sends emails
- **ReportService**: Generates reports
- **UserService**: Manages user accounts

**Why it matters**: Service inventory identifies reusable services.

---

### Service Inventory
**PM Definition**: Complete catalog of all existing functionality in the codebase.

**What it includes**:
- All services and their methods
- Utility functions
- Middleware components
- Integration points

**Why critical**: Prevents rebuilding functionality that already exists.

**When to run**: Before every new feature.

---

### Sprint
**PM Definition**: Fixed time period (usually 1-2 weeks) for completing planned work.

**Example sprint**:
- Week 1: Planning, discovery
- Week 2: Implementation, testing
- End of sprint: Review, demo, retrospective

**AI impact**: With this workflow, features that took full sprint now complete in days.

---

### Sub-ticket
**PM Definition**: Small, specific task that's part of an epic.

**Size**: 2-8 hours of work (completable in 1-2 days)

**Example** (from CSV Export epic):
- TASK-101: Create CSV formatter utility
- TASK-102: Add export API endpoint
- TASK-103: Build export button UI
- TASK-104: Add permission checks

**Created by**: Technical planning phase (AI decomposition)

---

## T

### Technical Debt
**PM Definition**: Shortcuts or workarounds in code that will need to be fixed later.

**Examples**:
- Temporary workarounds
- TODO comments
- Missing error handling
- Skipped tests

**Cost**: Accumulates over time, slows future development.

**Discovery phase**: Flags existing technical debt.

---

### Terminal
The application where you type commands. Called "Terminal" on Mac/Linux, "PowerShell" or "Command Prompt" on Windows. Same as CLI.

---

### Test Coverage
**PM Definition**: Percentage of code that has automated tests.

**Target**: 90%+ for production features

**Example**:
```
Total lines: 1000
Tested lines: 940
Coverage: 94%  ✅
```

**Why it matters**: Higher coverage = fewer bugs in production.

**PM perspective**: Look for the percentage, not the code details.

---

### Browser Automation / Visual QA
**PM Definition**: Testing tools (Playwright, Puppeteer, Chrome DevTools) that let AI agents test applications in real browsers like a human user would.

**What it enables**:
- Screenshots of actual UI for before/after comparison
- Testing on real browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge)
- Catching visual bugs (layout issues, broken images, animations)
- Testing user interactions (clicks, form fills, navigation)
- Detecting console errors and performance issues

**Real-world analogy**: Like having a QA tester who opens the app in a browser, clicks around, fills out forms, and takes screenshots to verify everything works and looks right.

**Examples of what it catches**:
- Button appears in wrong position on mobile
- Image doesn't load properly
- Form validation shows wrong error message
- Animation stutters or breaks
- Page takes too long to load

**Why PMs care**: Dramatically improves test quality for user-facing applications. Catches the visual/UX bugs that code-only tests miss.

**When to use**: Essential for consumer web apps, optional for backend APIs.

---

## U

### UI (User Interface)
**PM Definition**: Visual elements and controls users interact with.

**Components**:
- Buttons
- Forms
- Navigation
- Data displays
- Modals/dialogs

**PM ownership**: Define UI requirements in PRD, approve final implementation.

---

### UX (User Experience)
**PM Definition**: Overall experience of using your product, including usability, accessibility, and satisfaction.

**Aspects**:
- How easy is it to complete tasks?
- How fast does it feel?
- Is it accessible to all users?
- Does it guide users effectively?

**PM ownership**: Define UX requirements, validate against user research.

---

## V

### Version Control
**PM Definition**: System for tracking changes to code over time (usually Git).

**Benefits**:
- Full history of all changes
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Parallel development on branches
- Collaboration without conflicts

**PM interaction**: Minimal—developers and AI handle this automatically.

---

## W

### Worktree (Git Worktree)
**PM Definition**: An isolated working directory for a single ticket, allowing multiple features to be developed simultaneously without conflicts.

**Analogy**: Like having multiple copies of your codebase, each working on a different feature. But instead of actual copies (which waste disk space), git creates smart links that share the common parts.

**How it works in this workflow**:
1. Each ticket gets its own `.worktrees/[ticket-id]` directory
2. Multiple AI agents can work on different tickets at the same time
3. Changes in one worktree don't affect others
4. When work completes, worktree merges to main and gets removed automatically

**Real-world example**:
```
repo/                           # Main codebase
├── .worktrees/
│   ├── TICKET-101/            # Agent building authentication
│   ├── TICKET-102/            # Agent building payments
│   └── TICKET-103/            # Agent building reports

All three work simultaneously with zero conflicts!
```

**PM Impact**:
- **You don't manage worktrees** - they're created and removed automatically
- **Enables concurrent development** - multiple features can be built in parallel
- **No conflicts** - each ticket completely isolated from others
- **Just works** - run commands like `/adaptation` and `/implementation`, workflow handles the rest

**When you'll see it**:
- Linear ticket comments show: "**Worktree Path**: `/path/to/repo/.worktrees/TICKET-123`"
- Error messages might mention "worktree not found" (means: run `/adaptation` first)
- Commands navigate to worktrees automatically (you don't need to)

**Troubleshooting**:
- **"Worktree not found"** → Run `/adaptation TICKET-ID` first
- **"Worktree already exists"** → Choose "Reuse" or "Remove and recreate"
- **Disk space concerns** → Worktrees share git objects (very space-efficient)

**See Also**: [WORKTREE_GUIDE.md](WORKTREE_GUIDE.md) for comprehensive technical details (optional reading for PMs)

---

### Workflow
**PM Definition**: Series of steps to accomplish a task.

**This repository's workflow**:
```
Service Inventory → Discovery → Epic Planning →
Technical Planning → Implementation → Testing →
Code Review → Security Review → Documentation → Ship
```

**Each phase**: Has specific inputs, outputs, and quality gates.
