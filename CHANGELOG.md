## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

**Skill Descriptions Improved**

All 9 skills have been updated with improved descriptions following plugin-dev best practices:

- Descriptions now lead with purpose, not activation conditions
- Use third-person voice consistently ("This skill enforces..." not "Activate when...")
- Include specific trigger phrases in quotes for better auto-activation
- Reduced verbosity (under 70 words each)
- Removed redundant "Activation context" sections that duplicated frontmatter

Skills updated:
- `production-code-standards` - Enforces production-grade code quality
- `service-reuse` - Prevents code duplication

- **PreToolUse hook** (Write|Edit matcher): Reminds to follow production code standards before writing code
- **Stop hook**: Reminds users to update Linear ticket status when session involved implementation work

**Marketplace Metadata**

Enhanced `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` for better discoverability:

- Added `tags`: pm, workflow, linear, planning, security, code-review, documentation, testing, epic-planning, tdd
- Added `featuredCommand`: discovery
- Added `highlights` describing key features:
  - Complete PM-to-production workflow with 10 structured phases
  - Linear integration for seamless ticket management

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-02

### Breaking Changes

**Repository Structure Refactoring**

This release restructures the repository to follow Claude Code plugin conventions:

  - `claude/commands/` → `commands/`
  - `claude/agents/` → `agents/`
  - `claude/skills/` → `skills/`
- **Agent files renamed from snake_case to kebab-case**:
  - `architect_agent.md` → `architect-agent.md`
  - `backend_engineer_agent.md` → `backend-engineer-agent.md`
  - `code_reviewer_agent.md` → `code-reviewer-agent.md`
  - `design_reviewer_agent.md` → `design-reviewer-agent.md`
  - `frontend_engineer_agent.md` → `frontend-engineer-agent.md`
  - `qa_engineer_agent.md` → `qa-engineer-agent.md`

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

**Workflow Timing Documentation**

- Corrected project-level command timing guidance across README.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, and TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md
- Previously stated these commands run "once per project" which was incorrect
- Now accurately documents recurring usage:
  - `/generate_service_inventory` - Run after major codebase updates
  - `/discovery` - Run before each epic planning phase
  - `/epic-planning` - Run for each new feature, PRD, or major initiative
  - `/planning` - Run for each new epic
- Aligns with existing correct guidance in PM_GUIDE.md and GLOSSARY.md

### Added

**Model-Aware Behavior Skill**

- New `model-aware-behavior` auto-activated skill based on Anthropic's [Opus 4.5 migration guidance](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/claude-opus-4-5-migration/skills/claude-opus-4-5-migration)
- Enforces code exploration before proposing changes (addresses Opus 4.5's conservative exploration tendency)
- Scope control to prevent over-engineering (addresses Opus 4.5's tendency to create extra abstractions)
- Word substitutions for thinking sensitivity when extended thinking is disabled
- Parallel tool execution optimization

**Model Recommendations Documentation**

- Added "Model Recommendations" section to README.md with phase-by-phase guidance
- Opus 4.5 recommended as primary model for deep reasoning capabilities
- Explicit warning against Haiku 4.5 (cannot maintain context across complex operations)
- Cross-referenced in GET_STARTED.md for new user visibility

**Code Exploration Requirements**

- Added code exploration sections to `adaptation.md` and `implementation.md` commands
- Reinforces "read before proposing" behavior across workflow phases

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added

**Auto-Activated Quality Enforcement Skills**

Introduced 5 new skills that automatically activate during development to enforce standards and prevent issues before they occur. Skills shift enforcement LEFT—catching problems during creation rather than at review phases.

**New Skills:**

- **production-code-standards** - Blocks workarounds, temporary solutions, fallback logic hiding errors, TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, mocked services in production code, and silent error suppression. Activates when writing code in src/, lib/, app/ directories.

- **service-reuse** - Enforces checking service inventory before creating new services, utilities, or helpers. Prevents code duplication by mandating reuse of existing authentication, validation, and data access patterns.

- **testing-philosophy** - Requires fixing existing broken tests BEFORE writing new tests. Enforces accuracy-first testing: accurate tests that run > high coverage with broken tests.

- **mvd-documentation** - Enforces Minimal Viable Documentation standards. Documents the "why" not the "what"—TypeScript already shows the "what". Requires documentation for security-sensitive code.

- **security-patterns** - Enforces OWASP Top 10 patterns during development. Covers: broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection, insecure design, misconfiguration, vulnerable components, authentication failures, data integrity, logging failures, and SSRF.

**New Documentation:**

- `SKILLS.md` - Comprehensive guide explaining skills vs commands vs agents, installation instructions, and how to create custom skills

**Skill Design:**

- All skills follow skill-creator best practices with concise frontmatter triggers
- Workflow overviews at the start of each skill for clear enforcement steps
- BLOCK/REQUIRE labeling for prohibited vs required patterns
- Code examples demonstrating correct and incorrect approaches

### Benefits

**For Developers:**
- Proactive issue prevention during coding (not just at review time)
- Clear guidance on prohibited patterns with working alternatives
- Consistent enforcement of production-ready standards
- Security patterns applied automatically when writing sensitive code

**For Code Quality:**
- Reduced code review cycles (fewer issues to catch)
- Consistent application of OWASP security standards
- Enforced service reuse preventing duplicate implementations
- Test accuracy prioritized over coverage metrics

**Workflow Integration:**
```
Traditional:
  /implementation → code with issues → /codereview catches issues → fix

With Skills:
  /implementation → skill prevents issues → /codereview (fewer issues)
```
