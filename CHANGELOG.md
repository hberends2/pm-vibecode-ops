---

## [2.8.0] - 2026-01-11

### Added
- **ticket-context-agent**: New agent for gathering and summarizing ticket context from Linear when processing large epics
- **Scalable Context Gathering**: `/close-epic` now spawns parallel `ticket-context-agent` instances for epics with 7+ tickets, preventing context exhaustion
- **Retrofit Ticket Creation**: `/close-epic` now automatically creates detailed Linear tickets for each retrofit recommendation with full specifications (context, implementation guidance, acceptance criteria)

### Changed

- **close-epic.md**: Added threshold-based context gathering strategy (≤6 tickets: direct, 7+: parallel agents)
- **epic-closure-agent.md**: Retrofit recommendations now output ticket-ready specifications with full detail
- Updated agent count from 9 to 10 across documentation (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md)
- Updated TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md with new `/close-epic` features and Ticket Context Agent section

---

## [2.7.3] - 2026-01-09

### Changed
- **hooks.json**: Removed aggressive `Write|Edit` PostToolUse hook that was blocking legitimate work
- Production code standards validation now occurs at session end (Stop hook) instead of every file write
- Stop hook provides consolidated end-of-session summary with code review notes for operator review
- Code review notes only check production paths (`src/`, `lib/`, `app/`, `services/`, `modules/`, `controllers/`)
- Explicitly skips: `scripts/`, `tests/`, `__tests__/`, `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, config files, documentation

### Fixed
- Hooks no longer block utility scripts, one-off tools, or non-production code
- Reduced false positives from overzealous workaround detection during active development

---

## [2.7.2] - 2026-01-07

### Fixed

- **planning.md**: Added `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to allowed-tools and comprehensive instructions to fetch both epic description AND comments throughout the workflow

### Changed
- All Linear-interacting commands now explicitly require fetching both issue body/description AND comments
- Comments often contain critical context like phase reports, discovery findings, and previous analysis
- Audit confirmed: 9/11 commands fully compliant, 2/11 not applicable (discovery creates tickets, generate-service-inventory scans codebase)

---

## [2.7.1] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed
- **AGENTS.md**: Completely rewritten - was containing coding style guidelines instead of agent documentation
- **README.md**: Fixed command count from "10 commands" to "11 commands"

- **session-start.sh**: Added missing `epic-closure-validation` skill to the 10-skill list

### Changed
- Documentation consistency scrub ensuring all files accurately reflect: 9 agents, 10 skills, 11 commands

---

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added
- New `references/` directories for skills: verify-implementation, service-reuse, mvd-documentation
- New `examples/` directories for skills: production-code-standards, testing-philosophy, divergent-exploration
- Enhanced skill descriptions with specific user trigger phrases for better activation

---

## [2.6.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

**Epic Closure Command and Agent**

Introduced `/close-epic` command for formally closing completed epics with comprehensive analysis:

- **New Command**: `/close-epic <epic-id> [--skip-retrofit] [--skip-downstream]`
  - Six-phase closure workflow: Completion verification, retrofit analysis, downstream impact, documentation audit, CLAUDE.md updates, closure summary
  - Validates ALL sub-tickets are Done/Cancelled before allowing closure (blocking gate)
  - Extracts patterns worth propagating backward to existing code (retrofit analysis)
  - Propagates guidance to dependent epics (downstream impact)
  - Audits documentation coverage and proposes CLAUDE.md updates
  - Generates comprehensive closure report with lessons learned

- **New Agent**: `epic-closure-agent` (model: opus, color: gold)
  - Specialized for analyzing completed work and extracting actionable learnings
  - Follows orchestrator-agent pattern (no direct Linear access)
  - Skills: production-code-standards, verify-implementation, epic-closure-validation

- **New Skill**: `epic-closure-validation` (skill #10)
  - Auto-activates when closing epics
  - Blocks closure if any sub-ticket is incomplete
  - Validates no workarounds shipped and business value delivered

- **New Hook**: PostToolUse hook for `mcp__linear-server__update_issue`
  - Validates epic closure prerequisites when marking epics as Done
  - Prevents premature epic closure

**Workflow Enhancement**

- Added epic-level completion phase to workflow (phase 11)
- `/security-review` closes tickets, `/close-epic` closes epics
- Clear separation: ticket closure vs. epic closure

---

## [2.5.2] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

**Documentation Phase Auto-Converts Draft PRs**

Updated `/documentation` command to automatically convert draft PRs to "ready for review" without asking for user confirmation:

- Added new "Auto-Convert Draft PR to Ready for Review" section with bash commands
- Updated workflow step 15 to "PR State Change (AUTO)" with "DO NOT ask user, just do it"
- Updated "PR Status Updates" section to specify "AUTOMATIC DRAFT CONVERSION"
- Updated Success Criteria to reflect automatic PR state change

Documentation phase now moves PR from draft to ready for review when complete.

---

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

**Code Review Auto-Converts Draft PRs**

Updated `/codereview` command to automatically convert draft PRs to "ready for review" without asking for user confirmation:

- Added new "Auto-Convert Draft PR to Ready for Review" section with explicit automatic behavior
- Updated workflow step 16 to "PR State Change (AUTO)" with "DO NOT ask user, just do it"
- Updated "Moving PR from Draft to Ready for Review" section to reinforce automatic conversion
- Updated "PR Status Management" to specify "AUTOMATIC DRAFT CONVERSION"

Code review requires PRs to be ready for review, so this conversion is automatic and expected as part of the workflow.

---

## [2.5.0] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

**Orchestrator-Centric Pattern for Linear MCP Integration**

Implemented a major architectural change where commands handle ALL Linear I/O while agents operate as pure workers:

- **6 ticket-level commands updated** (adaptation, implementation, testing, documentation, codereview, security-review):
  - Fetch ticket details and comments BEFORE spawning agents
  - Embed ALL context into agent prompts
  - Write reports to Linear AFTER agents complete

- **8 agents converted to pure worker pattern**:
  - Removed Linear MCP tools from all agents
  - Added "Input: Context Provided by Orchestrator" section
  - Added "Output: Structured Report Required" section with standardized report format
  - Agents modified: architect, backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, qa-engineer, code-reviewer, technical-writer, security-engineer, design-reviewer

- **CLAUDE.md updated** with orchestrator-agent pattern documentation

### Removed

- Removed Linear MCP tools from all 8 agent definitions
- Removed unused `list_comments` from planning commands (epic-planning, planning retained tools for ticket CREATION only)

---

## [2.4.4] - 2026-01-06

### Fixed

**Security Review Command Shell Substitution Error**

Fixed error where `/security-review` command failed with "Command contains $() command substitution" due to Claude Code's security model blocking shell substitution patterns.

- Removed complex `$()` command substitution patterns from shell commands
- Replaced dynamic default branch detection with simple `origin/HEAD` reference
- Git automatically resolves `origin/HEAD` to the default branch
- Simplified from 4 complex shell commands to 3 simple git commands

---

## [2.4.3] - 2026-01-06

### Changed

**Conditional Linear MCP Integration**

Made Linear MCP integration conditional on ticket ID to preserve agent utility outside the workflow:

- **All 8 agents** updated with conditional ticket handling:
  - Linear MCP first/last actions now only mandatory **when a ticket ID is provided**
  - Added fallback: "If NO ticket ID is provided: You may work without Linear integration"
  - Tools remain documented and available for optional use
  - Agents can now be invoked for general work without requiring Linear tickets

- **Agents modified**: architect, backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, qa-engineer, code-reviewer, technical-writer, security-engineer, design-reviewer

---

## [2.4.2] - 2026-01-06

### Added

**Comprehensive Linear MCP Integration for Agents and Commands**

Fixed critical issue where agents were not using Linear MCP tools to read tickets before work or update tickets after completion. Agents were looking for shell scripts/APIs instead of understanding MCP tool invocation.

- **All 8 agents** now have standardized "🔗 CRITICAL: Linear MCP Integration" section including:
  - Clear explanation that these are MCP tools, NOT shell commands or APIs
  - Table of available Linear MCP tools with descriptions
  - **MANDATORY First Action**: Read ticket and comments before any work
  - **MANDATORY Last Action**: Add completion summary comment before finishing
  - Explicit reminder to invoke tools directly

- **All 6 ticket-level commands** now have three-step orchestration:
  - **Step 1: Pre-Agent Context Gathering** - Orchestrator reads ticket/comments BEFORE invoking agent
  - **Step 2: Agent Invocation** - Pass ticket context to agent in prompt
  - **Step 3: Post-Agent Verification** - Verify agent added completion comment

- **Commands updated**: adaptation, implementation, testing, documentation, codereview, security-review

---

## [2.4.1] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

**Linear MCP Tool Integration**

Fixed issues with agents not properly using Linear MCP tools. Agents were looking for shell scripts/commands instead of invoking MCP tools directly.

- **Agent frontmatter updated** (8 agents): Added missing Linear MCP tools to `tools:` field
  - `architect-agent`: Added `mcp__linear-server__get_issue`, `mcp__linear-server__list_comments`, `mcp__linear-server__list_issues`
  - All other agents: Added `mcp__linear-server__list_comments`
  - `design-reviewer-agent`: Added full Linear MCP tool set

- **Command syntax fixes**:
  - `epic-planning.md`: Removed non-existent milestone MCP functions, switched to label-based phase tracking
  - `planning.md`: Removed milestone functions, fixed JavaScript pseudocode to proper MCP tool instructions
  - `discovery.md`, `security-review.md`: Changed shell-like comments to markdown format
  - `epic-planning.md`: Added explicit "Using Linear MCP" section with proper tool invocation examples

---

## [2.4.0] - 2026-01-05

### Changed

**Improved Skill Trigger Specificity**

Updated all 9 skill descriptions with more explicit activation triggers based on Claude Code best practices research. Skills now use structured format with categorized triggers:

- **Skills updated**: `production-code-standards`, `service-reuse`, `testing-philosophy`, `mvd-documentation`, `security-patterns`, `model-aware-behavior`, `using-pm-workflow`, `verify-implementation`, `divergent-exploration`

- **New description format**:
  - Lead with purpose (what skill enforces)
  - Explicit "ACTIVATE when:" section with categorized triggers
  - User phrases, file patterns, tool usage, and context cues
  - Clear "ENFORCES/BLOCKS/REQUIRES" summary

**Mandatory Agent Invocation in Commands**

Added explicit mandatory language to all 8 workflow commands requiring agent invocation via Task tool:

- **Commands updated**: `discovery`, `planning`, `adaptation`, `implementation`, `testing`, `documentation`, `codereview`, `security-review`

- **New section added** (after frontmatter): "MANDATORY: Agent Invocation Required"
  - Bold statement: "You MUST use the Task tool to invoke the [agent-name]"
  - Numbered steps for required process
  - Clear prohibition: "DO NOT attempt to perform [work] directly"

- **Agent mapping**:
  - `discovery`, `planning`, `adaptation` → `architect-agent`
  - `implementation` → `backend-engineer-agent` / `frontend-engineer-agent`
  - `testing` → `qa-engineer-agent`
  - `documentation` → `technical-writer-agent`
  - `codereview` → `code-reviewer-agent`
  - `security-review` → `security-engineer-agent`

---

## [2.3.2] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

**Security Review Git Reference Bug**

Fixed `origin/HEAD` reference error in `/security-review` command that occurred in repositories where `origin/HEAD` symbolic reference is not configured (e.g., locally initialized repos with manually added remotes).

- **Commands updated**:
  - `commands/security-review.md`: Dynamic default branch detection with fallback chain
  - `codex/prompts/security-review.md`: Same fix for platform-agnostic version

- **Fix details**:
  - Uses `git symbolic-ref` first (fastest when available)
  - Falls back to `git remote show origin` (works on any repo)
  - Final fallback to `main` if detection fails
  - Added graceful error handling with fallback to `HEAD~5` for diff/log commands

---

## [2.3.1] - 2026-01-05

### Fixed

**Discovery Reference Standardization**

Updated commands and documentation to consistently reference Linear discovery tickets as the primary workflow:

- **Commands updated**:
  - `/epic-planning`: Clarified discovery argument accepts ticket ID (e.g., `DISC-001`) or markdown file path
  - `/planning`: Updated `--discovery` flag description and examples to show ticket IDs as primary
  - `/adaptation`: Updated argument hint and examples to use discovery ticket IDs

- **Documentation updated**:
  - PM_GUIDE.md: Fixed 3 references to use discovery ticket IDs instead of markdown files
  - QUICK_REFERENCE.md: Updated example commands to use `DISC-001` format
  - FAQ.md: Fixed 2 example references
  - TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md: Updated usage syntax and examples for epic-planning and planning

The `/discovery` command creates a Linear ticket as its artifact, so downstream commands should reference that ticket ID by default. Markdown file paths remain supported as an alternative.

---

- Added `description` field to all hook configurations for better discoverability
- Made Stop hook conditional (only reminds about Linear when workflow commands were used)

---

## [2.2.0] - 2026-01-02

---

## [1.1.1] - 2025-11-26

### Fixed

**Workflow Timing Documentation**

- Corrected project-level command timing guidance across README.md, QUICK_REFERENCE.md, and TECHNICAL_REFERENCE.md
- Previously stated these commands run "once per project" which was incorrect
- Now accurately documents recurring usage:
  - `/generate-service-inventory` - Run after major codebase updates
  - `/discovery` - Run before each epic planning phase
  - `/epic-planning` - Run for each new feature, PRD, or major initiative
  - `/planning` - Run for each new epic
- Aligns with existing correct guidance in PM_GUIDE.md and GLOSSARY.md

### Added

**Model-Aware Behavior Skill**

- New `model-aware-behavior` auto-activated skill based on Anthropic's [Opus 4.5 migration guidance](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/claude-opus-4-5-migration/skills/claude-opus-4-5-migration)
- Enforces code exploration before proposing changes (addresses Opus 4.5's conservative exploration tendency)
- Scope control to prevent over-engineering (addresses Opus 4.5's tendency to create extra abstractions)
- Word substitutions for thinking sensitivity when extended thinking is disabled
- Parallel tool execution optimization

**Model Recommendations Documentation**

- Added "Model Recommendations" section to README.md with phase-by-phase guidance
- Opus 4.5 recommended as primary model for deep reasoning capabilities
- Explicit warning against Haiku 4.5 (cannot maintain context across complex operations)
- Cross-referenced in GET_STARTED.md for new user visibility

**Code Exploration Requirements**

- Added code exploration sections to `adaptation.md` and `implementation.md` commands
- Reinforces "read before proposing" behavior across workflow phases

---

## [1.1.0] - 2025-11-26

### Added

**Auto-Activated Quality Enforcement Skills**

Introduced 5 new skills that automatically activate during development to enforce standards and prevent issues before they occur. Skills shift enforcement LEFT—catching problems during creation rather than at review phases.

**New Skills:**

- **production-code-standards** - Blocks workarounds, temporary solutions, fallback logic hiding errors, TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, mocked services in production code, and silent error suppression. Activates when writing code in src/, lib/, app/ directories.

- **service-reuse** - Enforces checking service inventory before creating new services, utilities, or helpers. Prevents code duplication by mandating reuse of existing authentication, validation, and data access patterns.

- **testing-philosophy** - Requires fixing existing broken tests BEFORE writing new tests. Enforces accuracy-first testing: accurate tests that run > high coverage with broken tests.

- **mvd-documentation** - Enforces Minimal Viable Documentation standards. Documents the "why" not the "what"—TypeScript already shows the "what". Requires documentation for security-sensitive code.

- **security-patterns** - Enforces OWASP Top 10 patterns during development. Covers: broken access control, cryptographic failures, injection, insecure design, misconfiguration, vulnerable components, authentication failures, data integrity, logging failures, and SSRF.

**New Documentation:**

- `SKILLS.md` - Comprehensive guide explaining skills vs commands vs agents, installation instructions, and how to create custom skills

**Skill Design:**

- All skills follow skill-creator best practices with concise frontmatter triggers
- Workflow overviews at the start of each skill for clear enforcement steps
- BLOCK/REQUIRE labeling for prohibited vs required patterns
- Code examples demonstrating correct and incorrect approaches

### Benefits

**For Developers:**
- Proactive issue prevention during coding (not just at review time)
- Clear guidance on prohibited patterns with working alternatives
- Consistent enforcement of production-ready standards
- Security patterns applied automatically when writing sensitive code

**For Code Quality:**
- Reduced code review cycles (fewer issues to catch)
- Consistent application of OWASP security standards
- Enforced service reuse preventing duplicate implementations
- Test accuracy prioritized over coverage metrics
