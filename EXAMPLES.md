## Example 1: Export to CSV Feature

### Context

**Company**: B2B SaaS analytics platform (Series A startup)
**PM Background**: Non-technical PM with MBA, 2 years experience
**Challenge**: Losing deals because competitors offer data export. Sales team ranks this as #1 feature request.

### The PRD

```markdown
# CSV Export Functionality - PRD

## Problem Statement

Analytics users need to export dashboard data to perform custom analysis
in Excel/Google Sheets. Currently, they screenshot dashboards or manually
copy data. This is a top sales blocker—we lost 5 deals in Q4 worth $120K ARR.

## User Personas

**Primary**: Data Analysts at enterprise customers
- Need: Export 1000-5000 rows for custom analysis
- Frequency: Weekly exports
- Pain: Manual data entry from screenshots takes 2+ hours weekly

**Secondary**: Executives creating board presentations
- Need: Clean data exports for presentations
- Frequency: Monthly
- Pain: Can't verify data accuracy when manually transcribed

## Success Criteria

**User Metrics**:
- 30% of power users export data weekly within 30 days of launch
- Average export size: 2500 rows
- Export completion rate >95% (handle errors gracefully)

**Business Metrics**:
- Unblock $120K in blocked deals
- Reduce churn risk for 3 at-risk accounts
- Close feature gap with competitors (Tableau, Looker)

**Technical Metrics**:
- Export generation time <5 seconds for 5000 rows
- Server memory usage <100MB per export
- Support concurrent exports (10+ users simultaneously)

## User Stories

### Story 1: Basic Export
As a data analyst, I want to export dashboard data to CSV
so that I can perform custom analysis in Excel.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Export button visible on all dashboard views
- CSV includes all visible columns with proper headers
- File downloads with descriptive name: dashboard-{name}-{date}.csv
- Exports respect current filters and date ranges
- Loading indicator shows progress for exports >1000 rows

### Story 2: Large Dataset Handling
As a power user, I want to export datasets up to 10,000 rows
so that I can analyze complete data sets.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Exports up to 10,000 rows (pagination UX for larger datasets)
- Progress indicator shows % completion
- Cancellable for long-running exports
- Error message if dataset exceeds 10,000 rows with workaround suggestion

### Story 3: Error Handling
As a user, I want clear error messages if export fails
so that I know what went wrong and how to fix it.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Network errors: "Connection lost. Please try again."
- Size errors: "Dataset too large. Please add filters to reduce data."
- Permission errors: "Insufficient permissions. Contact administrator."
- All errors log to analytics for debugging

## Business Context

**Market Position**:
- Competitors: Tableau, Looker, Metabase all offer CSV export
- Differentiation: We're faster and cheaper, but missing table stakes features

**Revenue Impact**:
- $120K ARR blocked (5 deals)
- $45K ARR at risk (3 accounts considering churn)
- Sales cycle impact: +2 weeks average due to this objection

**Strategic Importance**: HIGH
- Closes feature gap with competitors
- Unblocks sales pipeline
- Reduces churn risk

## Scope

**In Scope for V1**:
- Export visible dashboard data to CSV
- Support for up to 10,000 rows
- Proper error handling and progress indicators
- File naming with dashboard name and date

**Out of Scope** (Future Versions):
- Export to Excel (.xlsx) format
- Scheduled/automated exports
- Export to Google Sheets directly
- Custom column selection

## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance**:
- Generate CSV for 5000 rows in <5 seconds
- Support 10+ concurrent exports
- Memory usage <100MB per export

**Security**:
- Respect existing data permissions (users only export data they can view)
- Audit log for all exports (who, what, when)
- No data leakage across tenants (multi-tenant security)

**Compatibility**:
- CSV format compatible with Excel, Google Sheets, Numbers
- UTF-8 encoding for international characters
- Proper escaping of special characters

**Accessibility**:
- Export button keyboard accessible
- Screen reader announces export progress
- Error messages screen reader compatible
```

### Workflow Execution

#### Step 1: Service Inventory (5 minutes)

```bash
/generate_service_inventory ./src services-inventory.md
```

**Findings**:
- ✅ Existing `ReportService` handles data fetching
- ✅ Existing `AuthorizationService` for permission checks
- ✅ Existing `AuditLogService` for tracking exports
- ❌ No CSV formatting utility (need to create)

**PM Decision**: Good news—70% of the functionality exists. We only need to add CSV formatting and wire it up.

#### Step 2: Discovery (10 minutes)

```bash
/discovery csv-export-prd.md Analytics ./src "reporting, data export"
```

**Discovery Findings** (from Linear ticket):
- Tech stack: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React
- Existing pattern: ReportService returns JSON, frontend formats
- Similar feature: PDF export (can follow same architectural pattern)
- Potential reuse: Use same permission checking as PDF export
- Performance note: Queries are already optimized with proper indexes

**PM Review**: AI understands our architecture. PDF export pattern is perfect template.

#### Step 3: Epic Planning (15 minutes)

```bash
/epic-planning csv-export-prd.md DISC-001 "market-leader" "sales-blocker"
```

**AI Proposed Epics**:

1. **CSV Export Core Functionality**

2. **Large Dataset Handling & Performance**
   - Business Value: Support enterprise customers with big datasets
   - Success Metric: 95% completion rate for exports up to 10K rows
   - Estimated: 1 sprint

3. **Error Handling & User Feedback**
   - Business Value: Reduce support tickets, improve UX
   - Success Metric: <5 support tickets per 1000 exports
   - Estimated: 1 sprint

**PM Approval**:
- ✅ Approve Epic 1 (Priority 1 - must have)
- ✅ Approve Epic 2 (Priority 1 - enterprise requirement)
- ✅ Approve Epic 3 (Priority 2 - can ship without if needed)

**Decision**: Ship Epics 1 & 2 first. Epic 3 can follow in next sprint if timeline is tight.

#### Step 4: Technical Planning (20 minutes)

```bash

## Example 3: Real-Time Notifications System

### Context

**Company**: Project management SaaS (Series B)
**PM Background**: Non-technical PM from consulting
**Challenge**: Users miss important updates. Email notifications are ignored.

### The PRD (Abbreviated)

```markdown
# Real-Time Notifications System - PRD

## Problem
Users miss critical project updates because email notifications are delayed
and often ignored. This leads to missed deadlines and poor coordination.

## Solution
In-app real-time notifications with smart prioritization.

## Success Criteria
- 80% of notifications viewed within 5 minutes
- 50% reduction in missed deadlines
- 90% user satisfaction with notification system

## Features
1. Real-time notification center
2. Desktop notifications (opt-in)
3. Notification prioritization (urgent/normal/low)
4. Notification preferences per project
5. Read/unread tracking
```

### Workflow Execution (Summary)

**Service Inventory**: No existing real-time infrastructure (major gap)

**Discovery**: Identified event-driven architecture already in use

**Epic Planning**: 4 epics created
- Epic 1: Real-Time Infrastructure (WebSocket server)
- Epic 2: Notification Center UI
- Epic 3: Notification Preferences
- Epic 4: Desktop Notifications

**Interesting Decision**: PM approved Epic 1 even though it was pure infrastructure (no user-facing value yet), because AI explained it was prerequisite.

**Implementation**: 10 days total (infrastructure was complex)

### Results (90 Days)

**User Metrics**:
- ✅ 84% notifications viewed within 5 minutes (target: 80%)
- ✅ 52% reduction in missed deadlines (target: 50%)
- ✅ 92% user satisfaction (target: 90%)

**Technical**:
- Scaled to 10,000 concurrent WebSocket connections
- 99.7% uptime for notification service
- Average notification latency: 380ms

**Business Impact**:
- Customer satisfaction (CSAT) improved 15 points
- Support tickets for "missed updates" down 68%
- Feature became competitive differentiator

### PM Insights

**Biggest Challenge**: Approving "pure infrastructure" epic without immediate user value

**How Overcome**: AI explained:
- Why WebSocket infrastructure was needed
- Estimated 4 days for infrastructure
- Showed user-facing value would come in Epic 2

**Learning**: Sometimes you need to trust AI on technical prerequisites even when they're not user-facing.

## Example 4: Multi-Tenant Dashboard

### Context

**Company**: Healthcare SaaS platform (Series A)
**PM Background**: Domain expert (former hospital administrator)
**Challenge**: Onboarding new hospital clients takes 2-3 weeks of custom configuration.

### The PRD (Abbreviated)

```markdown
# Multi-Tenant Configuration Dashboard - PRD

## Problem
IT admins at hospitals spend 2-3 weeks configuring our system for their
organization. This delays time-to-value and strains our implementation team.

## Solution
Self-service configuration dashboard for IT admins.

## Success Criteria
- Reduce onboarding time to 2 days
- 95% of configurations self-service (no support needed)
- Zero security incidents from tenant isolation

## Key Features
1. Organization settings management
2. User role configuration
3. Department/unit hierarchy setup
4. Integration configurations (HL7, FHIR)
5. Security & compliance settings
```

### Workflow Execution (Summary)

**Service Inventory**: Found existing multi-tenant infrastructure but no admin UI

**Discovery**: Identified strict HIPAA compliance requirements, existing security patterns

**Epic Planning**: 5 epics
- Epic 1: Organization Settings UI
- Epic 2: Role Management
- Epic 3: Department Hierarchy
- Epic 4: Integration Configuration
- Epic 5: Security & Audit Logs

**Critical**: Security review found 2 potential tenant isolation bugs *before* production

**Implementation**: 12 days (security was complex)

### Results (180 Days)

**Business Metrics**:
- ✅ Onboarding time reduced to 1.8 days (target: 2 days)
- ✅ 97% self-service rate (target: 95%)
- ✅ Zero security incidents (target: zero)

**Operational Impact**:
