## Command Reference

### Project-Level Commands

These commands run at recurring intervals throughout the project lifecycle—not just once at setup. Service inventory runs after major codebase changes, discovery runs before each epic planning phase, epic planning runs for each new feature or PRD, and planning runs for each new epic.

#### `/generate_service_inventory`

**Purpose**: Creates comprehensive inventory of all existing services, utilities, and infrastructure components to prevent duplication.

**Usage**: `/generate_service_inventory [root-path] [output-file]`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Scan src directory, output to inventory.md
/generate_service_inventory ./src inventory.md

# Scan entire project
/generate_service_inventory . services-inventory.md
```

**Key Features**:
- Catalogs all services, utilities, helpers, and components
- Maps middleware, guards, decorators, and interceptors
- Documents event systems and data access patterns
- Creates reuse matrix for future development

**Output**: Markdown file with complete service catalog and reuse recommendations.

**Time**: 2-5 minutes

---

#### `/discovery`

**Purpose**: Analyzes codebase structure, patterns, and architectural decisions before implementation.

**Usage**: `/discovery [ticket-id] [codebase-path] [focus-areas]`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Basic discovery
/discovery prd.md ProjectName ./src

# With focus areas
/discovery user-profile-prd.md MyApp ./src "user management, data storage"
```

**Key Features**:
- Maps directory structure and technology stack
- Identifies design patterns and conventions
- Documents integration points and dependencies
- Creates foundation for adaptation and planning

**Output**: Creates Linear ticket with discovery findings.

**Time**: 5-10 minutes

---

#### `/epic-planning`

**Purpose**: Transforms PRD and business requirements into capability-focused epics with comprehensive duplicate prevention.

**Usage**: `/epic-planning [prd-document] [discovery-ticket-or-file] [business-context] [strategic-focus]`

**Examples**:
```bash
# With discovery ticket (recommended)
/epic-planning prd.md DISC-001

# With business context
/epic-planning prd.md DISC-001 "market-leader" "user-value"

# Alternative: using discovery markdown file
/epic-planning prd.md ./discovery-report.md "market-leader"
```

**Key Features**:
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Multi-layered checks prevent creating duplicate epics
- Pre-flight verification of ALL existing epics before creation
- Similarity scoring and execution plan with user approval
- Creates capability-focused epics (WHAT and WHY, not HOW)
- Quantifies business value for each epic
- Creates project for 4+ epics (Linear project, Jira board, etc.)
- Unique labels ensure idempotency if interrupted

**Duplicate Prevention Workflow**:
1. Queries and documents all existing epics
2. Cross-references each new capability against existing work
3. Creates execution plan (CREATE/SKIP/UPDATE) for user approval
4. Atomic creation with tracking prevents partial states
5. Recovery procedures if duplicates detected

**Ticketing System Integration**:
- **Project Management**: Appends epic planning summary to project description
- **Milestone Creation**: Creates milestones for delivery phases
- **Epic Association**: Links epics to appropriate project milestones with unique labels
- **Business Metrics**: Tracks user outcomes and success metrics in epic descriptions

**Output**: Creates epics in Linear/Jira with complete business context.

**Time**: 10-15 minutes + 20-30 minutes PM review

---

#### `/planning`

**Purpose**: Technical decomposition - breaks epics into actionable sub-tickets with proper dependencies.

**Usage**: `/planning <epic-ids> [--prd <prd-file>] [--discovery <ticket-id-or-file>] [--context <additional-context>]`

**Examples**:
```bash
# Single epic
/planning LIN-123

# Multiple epics with discovery ticket (recommended)
/planning LIN-123,LIN-124 --discovery DISC-001

# Epic with all context sources
/planning LIN-456 --prd requirements.md --discovery DISC-002 --context "Must support 10k concurrent users"

# Process all epics in a project
/planning PROJ-789 --discovery DISC-003

# Alternative: using discovery markdown file
/planning LIN-123 --discovery ./discovery-report.md
```

**Key Features**:
- **Primary Input**: Epic IDs (comma-separated) or Project ID
- **Optional Context**:
  - `--prd`: Original PRD for detailed requirements
  - `--discovery`: Discovery ticket ID (e.g., `DISC-001`) or markdown file with technical patterns and service inventory
  - `--context`: Ad-hoc constraints or requirements
- **Sub-ticket Creation**: All tickets created as children of parent epics
- **Technical Sizing**: 2-8 hour implementation chunks
- **Dependencies**: Maps blocking relationships between sub-tickets
- **Context Priority**: Epic → User context → Discovery → PRD

**Output**: Creates sub-tickets in ticketing system with technical specifications.

**Time**: 5-10 minutes + 15 minutes PM review

**Testing Philosophy** (Accuracy-First):
1. API Accuracy (100% required) - Use actual implementation
2. Compilation (100% required) - Zero TypeScript errors
3. Execution (100% required) - Tests must run
4. Coverage (secondary) - 70-90% after gates 1-3

**Priority Testing**:
- **High**: Complex business logic, financial calculations, auth/authz, data transformation
- **Low/Skip**: Simple CRUD without logic, configuration files, UI without behavior

**Output**: Passing test suite committed to feature branch.

**Time**: 30-60 minutes + 10 minutes PM review

---

#### `/documentation`

**Purpose**: Creates comprehensive documentation using the technical writer agent after testing is complete. Does NOT close the ticket—subsequent phases (code review, security review) still follow.

**Usage**: `/documentation [ticket-id]`

```bash
/documentation TICKET-201
```

**Key Features**:
- Technical writer agent generates API documentation
- Creates user guides and inline code documentation
- Ensures 100% JSDoc coverage for public APIs
- Generates examples and usage patterns
- Creates README updates if needed
- Commits documentation with the feature code
- **Keeps ticket "In Progress" for subsequent review phases**

## Best Practices

### Service Reuse

- Always check service inventory before creating new functionality
- Mandate reuse of existing services in tickets
- Prefer event-driven patterns over direct coupling
- Document anti-duplication requirements

### Branch Management

- Never commit to main/master branches
- Use consistent feature branch naming: `feature/[ticket-id]-description`
- Verify branch before any commits
- Keep all phases on same feature branch

### Scope Control

- Each phase handles only its responsibilities
- Implementation doesn't write tests
- Testing doesn't fix unrelated issues
- Security review doesn't fix code quality

### Documentation Standards

- 100% JSDoc coverage for public APIs
- No placeholder content or TODOs
- All code examples must be tested
- Document actual behavior, not intended

### Success Metrics

Commands track and report:
- **Reuse Rate**: Percentage of existing services leveraged
- **Coverage**: Test coverage percentages
- **Security Score**: OWASP compliance rating
- **Performance**: Core Web Vitals metrics
- **Quality**: Code review scores and findings
