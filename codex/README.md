# Codex Prompts Overview

This directory contains **platform-agnostic prompts** designed for use with the OpenAI Codex CLI (and similar tools). They mirror the Claude Code workflow but use plain Markdown prompts instead of slash commands or agent configs.

## Prerequisites

Before using these prompts, you need OpenAI Codex installed:

**Installation** (see [official docs](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)):
```bash
npm i -g @openai/codex
codex --version  # Verify installation
codex            # Authenticate (requires ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business/Edu/Enterprise)
```

For complete installation instructions, see:
- [OpenAI Codex CLI Documentation](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli)
- [OpenAI Help Center - Getting Started](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/11096431-openai-codex-cli-getting-started)

## Key Goals

- Keep behavior as close as possible to the Claude Code workflow.
- Use **simple mode** only: standard git branches.
- Assume MCP-style integrations for ticketing (Linear) when available.

## Files and Phases

Directory structure:

```

├── README.md                    # This file
├── AGENTS.md                    # Agent usage guide
├── SKILLS_REFERENCE.md          # Skills by workflow phase
├── HOOKS_GUIDE.md               # Manual hook alternatives
├── prompts/                     # 10 workflow prompts
├── skills/                      # Quality enforcement skills
└── agents/                      # Agent persona templates
```

Each prompt corresponds to a workflow phase:

- `generate-service-inventory.md` – Project-level service inventory
- `discovery.md` – Technical discovery and architecture mapping
- `epic-planning.md` – Epic creation from PRDs
- `planning.md` – Ticket decomposition and planning
- `adaptation.md` – Ticket-level implementation planning
- `implementation.md` – Production implementation
- `testing.md` – Test design and execution
- `documentation.md` – Documentation phase
- `codereview.md` – Code review
- `security-review.md` – Security review (final gate)

Prompts are designed to be copied into Codex sessions or referenced from your own CLI wrappers.

Skills and agents provide additional quality enforcement and specialized expertise (see sections below).

## Simple-Mode Assumptions

Codex prompts assume:

- A single working copy of the repo.
- A **feature branch per ticket**, created from `main` or a parent feature branch.
- Linear as the primary ticket system, accessed via MCP tools when available.

Each prompt includes a **“Repository and Branch Context (Simple Mode)”** section to keep the model anchored to:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
git branch --show-current
```

## MCP and Linear Integration

Where possible, prompts use **Linear MCP** naming and behavior:

- `mcp__linear-server__get_issue`
- `mcp__linear-server__list_comments`
- `mcp__linear-server__create_comment`
- `mcp__linear-server__update_issue`
- `mcp__linear-server__list_issues`, `list_projects`, `create_project`, etc.

If MCP is not available in your Codex environment, you can adapt those steps to:

- Manual use of the Linear web UI, or
- Direct HTTP API calls (outside the prompt).

## Personas (Option A)

Each prompt starts with a short **persona paragraph** describing the role:

- Architect / Discovery Engineer (`adaption.md`, `discovery.md`, `planning.md`)
- Implementation Engineer (`implementation.md`)
- QA Engineer (`testing.md`)
- Technical Writer (`documentation.md`)
- Senior Code Reviewer (`codereview.md`)
- Security Engineer (`security-review.md`)

These personas mirror the **Claude agents** but stay within a single prompt so Codex can use them without extra configuration.

## Context Window Best Practice

**Important:** Run each prompt in a fresh Codex session. After completing a workflow phase and reviewing the output, close your Codex session and start a new one for the next prompt.

**Why this matters:**
- Each workflow phase generates substantial context (discovery findings, code analysis, test results, etc.)
- Running multiple prompts in sequence can overflow the context window
- Cross-phase context pollution reduces effectiveness (e.g., security review seeing implementation details)
- Fresh context ensures each phase works optimally

**In practice:**
1. Open Codex → Paste adaptation prompt → Review output → Close Codex
2. Open new Codex session → Paste implementation prompt → Review output → Close Codex
3. Open new Codex session → Paste testing prompt → Continue...

Each prompt creates persistent artifacts (Linear tickets, code commits, PRs), so you won't lose progress when starting fresh sessions.

## Codex Skills

Skills are **quality enforcement guidelines** that help maintain production standards during development. In Claude Code, skills auto-activate based on context. In Codex, you manually include relevant skill content in your prompts.

### Available Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `production-code-standards` | Blocks workarounds, temporary code, and fallback patterns |
| `service-reuse` | Enforces checking service inventory before creating new services |
| `testing-philosophy` | Requires fixing existing broken tests before writing new ones |
| `mvd-documentation` | Enforces "document why, not what" (Minimal Viable Documentation) |
| `security-patterns` | Enforces OWASP patterns during code writing |
| `model-aware-behavior` | Read all files before proposing changes |
| `using-pm-workflow` | Guide through workflow phases correctly |
| `verify-implementation` | Verify work before marking complete |
| `divergent-exploration` | Explore alternatives before converging on solutions |
| `epic-closure-validation` | Validates all tickets complete before epic closure |

### How to Use Skills

Include the relevant skill content at the beginning of your Codex prompt:

```bash
# View a skill
cat codex/skills/production-code-standards.md

# Combine skill with workflow prompt
cat codex/skills/production-code-standards.md codex/prompts/implementation.md
```

**When to use which skills:**

- **Implementation phase**: `production-code-standards`, `service-reuse`, `security-patterns`
- **Testing phase**: `testing-philosophy`, `verify-implementation`
- **Documentation phase**: `mvd-documentation`
- **Discovery/Planning**: `divergent-exploration`, `model-aware-behavior`
- **Epic closure**: `epic-closure-validation`

See **[SKILLS_REFERENCE.md](SKILLS_REFERENCE.md)** for detailed skill-to-phase mapping, usage examples, and reference file listings.

## Codex Agents

Agents are **persona templates** that provide specialized expertise for specific tasks. Unlike inline personas in prompts (which are brief), full agent templates include detailed instructions, quality gates, and output formats.

See **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** for complete documentation.

### Available Agents

| Agent | Expertise |
|-------|-----------|
| `architect-agent` | Discovery, planning, technical decomposition |
| `backend-engineer-agent` | Server-side implementation |
| `frontend-engineer-agent` | UI/UX implementation |
| `qa-engineer-agent` | Test suite creation |
| `code-reviewer-agent` | Code quality assessment |
| `technical-writer-agent` | Documentation generation |
| `security-engineer-agent` | Security reviews |
| `design-reviewer-agent` | UI/UX validation |
| `epic-closure-agent` | Epic closure analysis and lessons learned |
| `ticket-context-agent` | Parallel ticket context gathering for large epics |

### How to Use Agents

1. Copy the agent template from `codex/agents/`
2. Paste at the beginning of your Codex session
3. Provide the context the agent needs (ticket details, code paths, etc.)

```bash
# View an agent template
cat codex/agents/backend-engineer-agent.md

# Example: Use backend engineer for implementation
cat codex/agents/backend-engineer-agent.md
# Then paste into Codex and provide: ticket ID, implementation requirements
```

**Key difference from Claude Code:** In Claude Code, agents are invoked via the Task tool by orchestrating commands. In Codex, you directly use the agent template as your session persona.

## Recommended Usage Patterns

### Direct Copy-Paste

```bash
# View a prompt
cat codex/prompts/adaptation.md

# Copy its contents into your Codex session
```

Then, in Codex:
- Paste the prompt.
- Provide the required inputs (e.g., ticket ID, PRD path).
- Let Codex respond and follow its instructions.
- **Close the session after completion** and start fresh for the next prompt.

### Alias-Based Usage

For frequent use, create shell aliases:

```bash
alias codex_adaptation='cat /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/codex/prompts/adaptation.md'
alias codex_implementation='cat /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/codex/prompts/implementation.md'
```

Then:

```bash
codex_adaptation | pbcopy   # macOS example
# Paste into Codex
```

### Custom Wrappers

You can also wrap these prompts into your own CLI or scripts:

- Pre-fill ticket IDs or PRD paths.
- Inject repository-specific defaults (paths, frameworks).
- Log prompt usage for process auditing.

## Behavior Differences vs Claude Code

Compared to the `claude/` commands:

- No slash commands – prompts are copy-paste or wrapped.
- No explicit Task tool or agent configs – personas are inline.
- Linear integration is **recommended but optional**; if you don’t use MCP, adapt the steps.

The **quality gates and philosophy (no workarounds, service reuse, security-first)** are kept aligned with the Claude workflow wherever possible.

## Hooks (Manual Alternatives)

Claude Code uses hooks to automate quality enforcement at key moments (session start, tool use, session end). Codex doesn't have a hook system, but you can replicate these behaviors manually.

**Key hooks and their Codex alternatives:**

| Hook | Claude Code Behavior | Codex Alternative |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| SessionStart | Auto-injects workflow context and skill reminders | Review session checklist before starting |
| PostToolUse (Epic) | Blocks epic closure if sub-tickets incomplete | Complete epic closure checklist manually |
| Stop | Reviews code changes for TODO/FIXME/console.log | Run end-of-session review script |

See **[HOOKS_GUIDE.md](HOOKS_GUIDE.md)** for detailed checklists and automation scripts to replicate hook behaviors.

## Example 1: Ticket-Level Flow (Adaptation → Implementation → Testing)

Scenario: You have a Linear ticket `APP-123` and you want to run the ticket-level phases with Codex.

1. **Adaptation**
   - In your terminal (from the repo root):
     ```bash
     cat codex/prompts/adaptation.md
     ```
   - Copy the content into a Codex session.
   - When prompted, provide:
     - Linear ticket ID: `APP-123`
     - Any discovery report or extra context (if available).
   - Let Codex produce an adaptation report and proposed feature branch name (for example `feature/APP-123-user-invitations`), and ensure it documents that branch in the Linear comment.

2. **Implementation**
   - Check out the feature branch mentioned in the adaptation report (or create it if needed).
   - In the terminal:
     ```bash
     cat codex/prompts/implementation.md
     ```
   - Paste into Codex, provide:
     - Linear ticket ID: `APP-123`
     - Any additional implementation notes you want Codex to consider.
   - Let Codex guide and perform implementation changes on the feature branch.

3. **Testing**
   - Stay on the same feature branch.
   - In the terminal:
     ```bash
     cat codex/prompts/testing.md
     ```
   - Paste into Codex, provide:
     - Linear ticket ID: `APP-123`
     - Optional coverage target and test types (for example, “80% coverage, unit + integration”).
   - Follow the prompt’s Gate 0 (fix existing tests first), then let Codex design and refine new tests.

After these three phases, you can continue with:
- `codex/prompts/documentation.md`
- `codex/prompts/codereview.md`
- `codex/prompts/security-review.md`

## Example 2: Project-Level Flow (Discovery → Planning from a PRD)

Scenario: You have a PRD at `docs/user-notifications-prd.md` and want to generate tickets in Linear.

1. **Discovery**
   - From the repo root:
     ```bash
     cat codex/prompts/discovery.md
     ```
   - Paste into Codex and provide:
     - Project name and/or identifier.
     - Any existing service inventory files (if present).
   - Let Codex map the architecture, patterns, and integration points, and create/update a Linear discovery ticket.

2. **Planning**
   - Once discovery is done and recorded in Linear, run:
     ```bash
     cat codex/prompts/planning.md
     ```
   - Paste into Codex and provide:
     - PRD path: `docs/user-notifications-prd.md`
     - Any discovery report links or ticket IDs.
     - Scope or priority instructions (e.g., “v1 only, focus on email + in-app notifications”).
   - Let Codex:
     - Decide whether to create a Linear project/epic.
     - Decompose the PRD into well-scoped Linear tickets.
     - Ensure reuse checks against discovery/service inventory.

You can then pick up individual ticket IDs from the planning output and run the ticket-level flow (Example 1) for each one using Codex.
