# 📋 Sub-Ticket Workflow: Each Ticket Goes Through Full Implementation Chain

**When creating sub-tickets, each ticket will proceed through:**

1. **Adaptation** - Create implementation guide for the ticket
2. **Implementation** - Write production code
3. **Testing** - Build comprehensive test suite
4. **Documentation** - Generate docs and API references
5. **Code Review** - Quality and pattern assessment
6. **Security Review (FINAL GATE)** - Only this phase closes tickets

**Important:**
- All sub-tickets start in 'Todo' status
- They remain 'In Progress' through phases 1-5
- Only security review closes tickets when passed

---

## IMPORTANT: Linear MCP Integration
**ALWAYS use Linear MCP tools for ticket operations:**
- **List teams**: Use `mcp__linear-server__list_teams` to identify target team
- **Check projects**: Use `mcp__linear-server__list_projects` to prevent duplicates
- **Create project**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_project` for 4+ tickets
- **List issues**: Use `mcp__linear-server__list_issues` before creating new tickets
- **Create issues**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_issue` with unique scope
- **Update issues**: Use `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` for dependencies
- **Add comments**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` for updates
- **DO NOT**: Use GitHub CLI or direct Linear API calls - only use MCP tools

Ask the user to provide a PRD document, which is the primary requirements source. Then, transform Product Requirements Document (PRD) and supporting documents into actionable Linear tickets.

When providing the PRD, a user may also provide one or more of the following: 
- Discovery document
- Linear Ticket ID (before beginning, read body and comments for context)
- Supporting documents (technical specs, designs, etc.)
- Scope limit
- Priority focus

Analyze the PRD taking into account all other context the user provided, and decompose it into development tickets with clear dependencies and implementation guidance.

## Pre-Planning Analysis

### 1. Load and Parse PRD
```bash
# Load PRD document
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    echo "✓ PRD document found: $1"
else
    echo "ERROR: PRD document not found at $1"
    exit 1
fi

# Load supporting documents if provided
if [ "$2" != "none" ] && [ -f "$2" ]; then
    echo "✓ Supporting documents found: $2"
fi
```

### 2. PRD Analysis Requirements
Extract from the PRD:
- **Business Goals**: What problem are we solving?
- **User Stories**: Who are the users and what do they need?
- **Functional Requirements**: Core features and capabilities
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance, security, scalability
- **Success Metrics**: How will we measure success?
- **Constraints**: Technical, timeline, or resource limitations
- **Out of Scope**: What we explicitly won't build

## Code Quality Standards - NO WORKAROUNDS OR FALLBACKS

**CRITICAL: Production-Ready Planning Only**
When creating tickets from the PRD, the planning phase MUST:
- **NO WORKAROUND TICKETS**: Never create tickets for temporary solutions
- **PRODUCTION STANDARDS**: All tickets must describe production-ready implementations
- **FAIL FAST REQUIREMENTS**: Include proper error handling requirements
- **NO PLACEHOLDER FEATURES**: Every ticket must deliver complete functionality
- **PROPER DEPENDENCY CHAINS**: Identify and document all prerequisite work

## Planning Workflow

### 1. PRD Decomposition & Ticket Estimation
Analyze the PRD to determine scope:
```javascript
// Estimate ticket count from PRD
function estimateTicketCount(prd) {
  let ticketCount = 0;
  
  // Count major features
  ticketCount += prd.features.length;
  
  // Add infrastructure/setup tickets if needed
  if (prd.requiresNewInfrastructure) ticketCount += 2;
  
  // Add integration tickets
  ticketCount += prd.integrations.length;
  
  // Add security/compliance tickets if required
  if (prd.securityRequirements) ticketCount += 1;
  
  return ticketCount;
}
```

### 2. Project Creation Decision
**IMPORTANT: Create a Linear project (epic) ONLY if estimated tickets ≥ 4**

```bash
# Decision logic for project creation
ESTIMATED_TICKETS=$(analyze_prd_scope "$1")

if [ "$ESTIMATED_TICKETS" -ge 4 ]; then
    echo "📋 PRD requires $ESTIMATED_TICKETS tickets - Creating Linear Project"
    CREATE_PROJECT=true
else
    echo "📝 PRD requires $ESTIMATED_TICKETS tickets - Creating standalone tickets"
    CREATE_PROJECT=false
fi
```

### 3. Linear Project Setup (If ≥4 Tickets)

#### Check for Existing Projects
```bash
# MANDATORY: Check for existing projects first
echo "Checking for existing Linear projects..."
# Use mcp__linear-server__list_projects

# Look for projects with similar names or scope
# If found with >70% overlap, reuse it
# Otherwise, create new project
```

#### Create Project from PRD
When creating a project, extract from PRD:
```markdown
## Project: [PRD Title/Feature Name]

### Description
[PRD executive summary]

### Business Context
- Problem: [From PRD problem statement]
- Solution: [From PRD proposed solution]
- Users: [Target users from PRD]
- Value: [Business value/ROI]

### Success Metrics
[From PRD success criteria]

### Scope
- In Scope: [PRD functional requirements]
- Out of Scope: [PRD exclusions]

### Timeline
- Target: [From PRD timeline]
- Milestones: [Key deliverables]
```

### 4. Ticket Creation from PRD Requirements

**For Each Requirement in PRD**, create a ticket with:

```markdown
## Ticket Title: [Specific requirement from PRD]

### PRD Reference
- Section: [PRD section this addresses]
- Requirement ID: [If PRD has numbered requirements]
- User Story: [Related user story from PRD]

### Requirements
- Functional: [From PRD functional requirements]
- Non-functional: [Performance, security from PRD]
- Acceptance Criteria: [Derived from PRD success criteria]

### Technical Approach
- Implementation strategy: [How to build this]
- Architecture alignment: [How it fits the system]
- Dependencies: [Other tickets that must complete first]

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Meets PRD acceptance criteria
- [ ] Passes quality gates
- [ ] No workarounds or temporary code
- [ ] Documentation complete
```

### 5. Ticket Organization

#### If Project Created (≥4 tickets):
- Attach all tickets to the project
- Set ticket relationships and dependencies
- Add labels for tracking (feature-area, priority, complexity)
- Set milestones based on PRD timeline

#### If Standalone Tickets (<4 tickets):
- Add PRD reference in ticket description
- Link related tickets together
- Add consistent labels for tracking
- Note they're part of same PRD initiative

### 6. Service Inventory Check (If Available)

If a previous discovery has been run:
```bash
# Check for existing service inventory
if [ -f "context/service-inventory.yaml" ]; then
    echo "✓ Service inventory found - checking for reuse opportunities"
    # Analyze which PRD requirements can use existing services
    # Add reuse notes to relevant tickets
fi
```

## Ticket Sizing Guidelines

Based on PRD requirements, size tickets appropriately:
- **Small (2-4 hours)**: Single endpoint, simple UI component, configuration change
- **Medium (4-8 hours)**: Multiple endpoints, complex component, service integration  
- **Large (8+ hours)**: MUST SPLIT - Break into smaller tickets
- **Epic-level**: Create sub-tickets, never assign epic directly

## Project vs Standalone Decision Matrix

| PRD Scope | Ticket Count | Action | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|--------|-----------|
| Single feature | 1-3 | Standalone tickets | Overhead not justified |
| Feature set | 4-10 | Create project | Coordination needed |
| Major initiative | 11+ | Create project + sub-epics | Complex coordination |
| Bug fixes | Any | Standalone tickets | Not feature work |
| Tech debt | <4 | Standalone tickets | Unless coordinated effort |

## Linear Planning Report Format

After completing planning, add comment to project (if created) or first ticket:

```markdown
## 📋 Planning Phase Complete

### PRD Analysis Summary
- **PRD Title**: [From document]
- **Business Goal**: [Key objective]
- **User Impact**: [Who benefits and how]
- **Timeline**: [Target delivery]

### 📊 Planning Metrics
- **Total Tickets Created**: X
- **Project Created**: Yes/No (X tickets threshold)
- **Complexity Distribution**: S small, M medium, L large
- **Estimated Timeline**: N sprints
- **Dependencies Identified**: Y critical paths

### 🎯 Ticket Breakdown
| Ticket | PRD Section | Type | Priority | Complexity |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|------------|
| LIN-123 | Auth Requirements | Backend | P0 | Medium |
| LIN-124 | User Dashboard | Frontend | P1 | Large |
| LIN-125 | Data Privacy | Security | P0 | Medium |

### 🔗 Dependency Chain
1. Critical Path: LIN-123 → LIN-124 → LIN-125
2. Parallel Work: LIN-126, LIN-127 can start immediately
3. Blockers: None identified

### ⚠️ Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risks**: [From PRD constraints]
- **Timeline Risks**: [Aggressive deadlines]
- **Resource Risks**: [Skill gaps identified]

### 🚀 Next Steps
1. Run discovery phase for technical analysis
2. Begin implementation with P0 tickets
3. Schedule design review for UI components

**Planning Completed**: [Date/Time]
**Source PRD**: $1
**Project ID**: [If created]
```

## Success Criteria

Planning is successful when:
- **All PRD requirements mapped to specific tickets**
- **Project created if and only if ≥4 tickets needed**
- **Each ticket has clear PRD traceability**
- **Dependencies identified and documented**
- **No duplicate tickets created**
- **Timeline aligns with PRD expectations**
- **All tickets include production-ready requirements**
- **Clear "Definition of Done" for each ticket**

## Common PRD Patterns and Ticket Mapping

### Authentication/Authorization PRD Section
Typically generates:
- Database schema ticket
- Auth service implementation ticket  
- Frontend login/signup tickets
- Session management ticket
- Security review ticket

### Dashboard/Analytics PRD Section
Typically generates:
- Data aggregation service ticket
- API endpoints ticket
- Frontend dashboard tickets
- Caching layer ticket (if performance requirements)

### Integration PRD Section
Typically generates:
- External API client ticket
- Webhook handler ticket
- Data synchronization ticket
- Error handling/retry ticket

## Handoff to Discovery Phase

After planning completes:
1. Project/tickets created in Linear
2. Discovery phase can begin with project name
3. Discovery will create technical analysis ticket in project
4. Implementation can begin once discovery completes

The planning phase transforms PRD requirements into an actionable Linear workspace, creating projects for coordinated efforts (≥4 tickets) or standalone tickets for smaller initiatives, ensuring every requirement has a clear implementation path.
