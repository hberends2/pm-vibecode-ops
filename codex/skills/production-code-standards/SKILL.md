  Enforces production-grade code quality. Use when:
  - Writing code: "implement", "write code", "add feature", "fix bug", "create service", "build"
  - Detecting workarounds: "make it work", "quick fix", "temporary solution", "workaround", "hack"
  - Reviewing code: "review PR", "check this code", "is this production ready"
  - Editing production files: src/, lib/, app/, services/, modules/, controllers/, domain/

  Blocks TODO/FIXME/HACK comments, empty catch blocks, fallback logic, || default patterns,
  setTimeout for race conditions, mocked services outside tests. Enforces fail-fast error handling.

# Production Code Standards

All production code must be permanent, complete, and production-grade.

## Enforcement Workflow

1. **Before writing**: Plan the complete, permanent solution
2. **While writing**: Check against prohibited patterns
3. **When blocked**: STOP, document, create ticket - never workaround
4. **Before committing**: Verify no prohibited patterns exist

## Prohibited Patterns

| Pattern | Why Blocked |
|---------|-------------|
| `value \|\| default` | Hides errors silently |
| `TODO/FIXME/HACK` | Temporary code in production |
| `catch (e) { }` | Swallows errors |
| Mock services in src/ | Test artifacts in production |
| `setTimeout` for race conditions | Workaround, not fix |

## Required Patterns

| Pattern | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Fail-fast validation | Errors caught at entry |
| Typed custom errors | Debuggable, catchable |
| Error propagation | Let errors bubble to handlers |
| Repository pattern | Data access abstraction |

## When Blocked

If proper implementation is blocked:

1. **STOP** - Do not create a workaround
2. **DOCUMENT** - State what's blocking
3. **CREATE TICKET** - File ticket for the blocker
4. **WAIT** - Blocker must be fixed first

**If implementation requires a workaround, do not implement. Communicate the blocker clearly.**

- **testing-philosophy**: Test code may use mocks and fixtures; production code must not
- **verify-implementation**: Verify all claims before marking work complete

See `references/anti-patterns.md` for detailed code examples of prohibited and required patterns.

## How to Use This Skill in Codex

Include this skill's content in your Codex prompt when:
- Writing any production code (not test code)
- Reviewing code for production readiness
- Implementing features or fixing bugs
- Discussing code quality standards

Copy the prohibited and required patterns sections into your prompt to enforce these standards during code generation.
