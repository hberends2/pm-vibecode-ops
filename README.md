## What This Is

A battle-tested workflow that enables Product Managers and other non-engineers to transform product requirements into production-ready code through structured AI collaboration.

Write a PRD. Run 11 commands. Ship features with tests, documentation, and security review.

**Time**: Significantly faster delivery for routine features (50-75% time savings typical)
**Quality**: 90%+ test coverage, automated security review, comprehensive documentation
**Output**: Production-ready code that integrates cleanly with existing codebases

---

## Why This Matters

Traditional product development bottlenecks on engineering capacity. AI coding tools promise speed but without structure create unmaintainable chaos—duplicate code, security holes, missing tests, and technical debt.

This workflow provides the structure AI needs to help non-engineers move beyond prototypes and build production software reliably:

### Six Key Innovations

**1. Service Inventory System**
Automatically catalogs existing code before building anything new. Prevents the #1 AI coding disaster: rebuilding functionality that already exists.

**2. Adaptation Phase**
Transforms "what exists" into "how to build this feature." AI gets explicit guidance on which services to reuse and how to integrate with existing patterns.

**3. Automated Ticket Memory**
Your ticketing system (Linear/Jira) becomes AI's external memory. Discovery findings, architectural decisions, and implementation guidance persist across sessions—and you can read and verify everything AI knows.

**4. Specialized Agent Workflow**
Instead of one generic AI, you work with expert agents—architect, backend engineer, QA, security, technical writer. Each focuses on their specialty with strict boundaries to prevent scope creep.

**5. Auto-Activated Quality Skills (Claude Only)**
Skills enforce standards during development, not just at review time. Production code standards, security patterns, and testing philosophy activate automatically as Claude writes code—preventing issues before they're created.

**6. Production-First Quality Focus**
Zero tolerance for workarounds, fallbacks, or temporary solutions. Risk-based testing focuses on code that matters. Inline documentation AI can't miss. Strong guidance to fail fast and fix issues rather than building workarounds you'd otherwise miss. 

### What You Get

- **Prevent duplication**: Service inventory catches 60-75% code reuse opportunities
- **Maintain quality at scale**: Built-in gates ensure code remains maintainable as applications grow
- **Move faster on routine work**: Handle straightforward features without bottlenecking on engineering
- **Preserve engineering focus**: Engineers tackle complex challenges while AI handles CRUD operations

## Who This Is For

**Perfect for:**
- Product Managers leading technical teams who want to accelerate delivery
- Technical PMs who want to multiply their output on routine development
- Solo founders building MVPs with AI assistance
- Engineering leaders enabling non-technical staff to contribute safely

**Best suited for:**
- Internal tools and operational software
- MVPs and prototypes that evolve into products
- Standard web applications with common patterns
- Features for existing codebases following established conventions

**Requires additional engineering expertise for:**
- Mission-critical systems where failures have serious consequences
- Highly regulated industries (healthcare, finance) requiring deep compliance review
- Novel architectures or cutting-edge technology integration
- Systems requiring significant performance optimization

## Have Realistic Expectations

This workflow helps PMs and other non-engineers build software that works in production—with proper tests, documentation, and security review.

**It will not** produce the elegantly architected, concise, highly scalable code that senior engineers would write.

**It will** enable you to ship real features, maintain code quality as your application grows, and avoid the unmaintainable mess that unstructured AI coding creates.

The honest truth: AI-assisted development with proper quality gates produces reliable software for many use cases. It does not replace the judgment of experienced engineers for complex systems. Use this workflow for appropriate projects, and involve engineering expertise when stakes demand it.

---

## How It Works

The workflow consists of two phases:

### Project-Level Commands (Recurring)
1. `/generate-service-inventory` - Catalog existing code *(run after major codebase updates)*
2. `/discovery` - Analyze patterns and architecture *(run before each epic planning phase)*
3. `/epic-planning` - Create business-focused epics *(run for each new feature, PRD, or major initiative)*
4. `/planning` - Decompose epics into engineering tickets *(run for each new epic)*

### Ticket-Level Execution (For Each Feature)
5. `/adaptation` - Create implementation guide (reuse analysis, pattern selection)
6. `/implementation` - AI writes production code following guide
7. `/testing` - Build and fix comprehensive test suite until passing
8. `/documentation` - Generate API docs, user guides, inline documentation
9. `/codereview` - Automated quality checks and pattern compliance
10. `/security-review` - OWASP vulnerability scan → **closes ticket when passing**

### Epic-Level Completion
11. `/close-epic` - Close completed epic with retrofit analysis → **closes epic when all tickets done**

Each phase includes quality gates. Security review is the final gate that marks tickets as complete. Epic closure is the final gate that marks epics as complete after all sub-tickets pass.

**Best practice**: Run each command in a fresh Claude Code session to prevent context overflow and ensure optimal performance.

## Quick Start

### Choose Your Platform

**For Claude Code Users** (Recommended):
- Standard git branches, one ticket at a time → [Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

**For OpenAI Codex Users**:
- Platform-agnostic prompts in `codex/prompts/` → [Codex Guide](codex/README.md)

### Prerequisites

- AI coding tool (Claude Code or OpenAI Codex)
- Ticketing system with MCP integration ([Linear](https://linear.app) recommended, [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)  and other systems with MCP integrations supported)
- Git repository
- [Complete prerequisite checklist](docs/INSTALLATION.md#prerequisites)

### Installation

**Install from Claude Code Marketplace**:
```bash
# Add the marketplace first
/plugin marketplace add bdouble/pm-vibecode-ops

# Then install from marketplace
/plugin install pm-vibecode-ops@pm-vibecode-ops
```

When prompted, **select "User" scope** to make the plugin available across all projects.

That's it! The plugin system automatically installs all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

**Scope options explained**:
- **User** (recommended) - Available in all projects for you
- **Project** - Available to all collaborators in this repository (commits to `.claude/settings.json`)
- **Local** - Available only in this project, only for you

**What gets installed:**
- **Commands** (`/adaptation`, `/implementation`, etc.) - Explicit workflow phases you invoke
- **Agents** - Specialized AI roles (architect, QA engineer, security engineer)
- **Skills** - Auto-activated quality enforcement during development
- **Hooks** - Session automation for workflow context

**For OpenAI Codex users**: See [Codex Guide](codex/README.md) for platform-agnostic prompts.

**MCP configuration** (Linear, Perplexity, etc.): [docs/MCP_SETUP.md](docs/MCP_SETUP.md)
