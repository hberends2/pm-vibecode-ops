# Git Worktree Workflow - .gitignore Template
#
# Add these lines to your target repository's .gitignore file
# to exclude worktree directories and related files.
#
# NOTE: The /adaptation command automatically adds these entries
# to your .gitignore if they're missing, so manual addition is
# typically not necessary.

# Git worktrees for concurrent development
.worktrees/

# Worktree registry file (if used)
.worktree-registry.json

# Optional: Worktree-specific temporary files
.worktrees/**/node_modules/
.worktrees/**/.env.local
.worktrees/**/.DS_Store

# End of worktree-related ignores
