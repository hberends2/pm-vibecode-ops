## Terminal Basics

If you've never used a terminal before, this section is for you. If you're comfortable with command-line basics, skip to [Installing Prerequisites](#installing-prerequisites).

### What is a Terminal?

A terminal (also called "command line" or "shell") is a text-based way to interact with your computer. Instead of clicking icons, you type commands. It looks intimidating at first, but you'll only need a few basic commands.

**Don't worry**: You cannot break your computer by typing wrong commands. The worst that typically happens is an error message.

### Opening the Terminal

**On Mac**:
1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type "Terminal"
3. Press Enter

**On Windows**:
1. Press `Windows key`
2. Type "PowerShell" or "Terminal"
3. Click "Windows Terminal" or "PowerShell"

**On Linux**:
1. Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`
2. Or search for "Terminal" in your applications

### Essential Commands You'll Need

Here are the only commands you need to know:

| Command | What It Does | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| `cd` | Change directory (folder) | `cd Documents` |
| `cd ..` | Go up one folder | `cd ..` |
| `ls` | List files in current folder | `ls` |
| `pwd` | Show current folder path | `pwd` |
| `mkdir` | Create a new folder | `mkdir myproject` |

### Understanding File Paths

File paths tell the computer where to find things:

- **Absolute path**: Full path from root — `/Users/yourname/Documents/project`
- **Relative path**: Path from where you are — `Documents/project`
- **Home folder**: Represented by `~` — `~/Documents` means `/Users/yourname/Documents`

### Copying and Pasting in Terminal

**On Mac**:
- Copy: `Cmd + C`
- Paste: `Cmd + V`

**On Windows**:
- Copy: `Ctrl + C` (or right-click)
- Paste: `Ctrl + V` (or right-click)

**Pro tip**: You can often paste commands directly from this guide into your terminal.

### Your First Terminal Exercise

Let's make sure you're comfortable:

1. Open your terminal
2. Type `pwd` and press Enter — this shows where you are
3. Type `ls` and press Enter — this shows what files are here
4. Type `cd ~` and press Enter — this goes to your home folder
5. Type `pwd` again — you should see something like `/Users/yourname`

If these worked, you're ready to continue!

## Installing Prerequisites

### Step 1: Install Node.js

Node.js is required to run Claude Code and MCP servers.

#### On Mac

**Option A: Direct Download (Simplest)**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" version (the one that says "Recommended")
3. Run the installer, click through all the prompts
4. Restart your terminal

**Option B: Using Homebrew (Recommended for Mac users who want more control)**
```bash
# First, install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Then install Node.js
brew install node
```

#### On Windows

1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the "LTS" version
3. Run the installer
4. **Important**: Check the box that says "Automatically install necessary tools"
5. Complete the installation
6. Restart your terminal (close and reopen PowerShell)

#### On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt update

# Install Node.js
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

#### Verify Node.js Installation

Open a **new** terminal window and run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers like `v20.10.0` and `10.2.3`. The exact numbers may differ—that's okay!

**If you see "command not found"**: Close your terminal completely and open a new one. If it still doesn't work, restart your computer.

---

### Step 2: Install Git

Git tracks changes to your code and enables collaboration.

#### On Mac

**Option A: Xcode Command Line Tools (Easiest)**
```bash
xcode-select --install
```
Click "Install" when prompted.

**Option B: Homebrew**
```bash
brew install git
```

#### On Windows

1. Go to [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Download the installer
3. Run the installer with default settings
4. Restart your terminal

#### On Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt install git
```

#### Verify Git Installation

```bash
git --version
```

You should see something like `git version 2.39.0`.

#### Configure Git (First Time Only)

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Replace with your actual name and email.

---

### Step 3: Install a Code Editor (Optional but Recommended)

While you don't need to write code, having a code editor helps you:
- Read PRDs and documentation
- Review AI-generated files
- Navigate project structures

**Recommended: Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**

1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Download for your operating system
3. Install with default settings

---

## Installing Claude Code

### Step 1: Get Your Anthropic API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to "API Keys"
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-...`)
6. **Save this key securely** — you'll need it in a moment

### Step 2: Install Claude Code

In your terminal, run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**What this does**: Installs Claude Code globally so you can use it from anywhere.

**If you see permission errors on Mac/Linux**:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
Enter your computer password when prompted (you won't see characters as you type—that's normal).

### Step 3: Configure Your API Key

**Option A: Set Environment Variable (Recommended)**

**On Mac/Linux**, add to your shell profile:
```bash
# Open your profile file
nano ~/.zshrc   # or ~/.bashrc if using bash

# Add this line at the bottom:
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"

# Save: Ctrl+O, Enter, then Ctrl+X to exit
# Reload:
source ~/.zshrc
```

**On Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
# Set permanently
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-your-key-here", "User")

# Restart PowerShell
```

**Option B: Pass Key Each Session**

If you prefer not to save the key permanently:
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
```
You'll need to run this each time you open a new terminal.

### Step 4: Verify Claude Code Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see a version number. Then test it:

```bash
claude "Hello, are you working?"
```

If Claude responds, you're ready!

## Installing the Workflow

This workflow provides commands and agents for both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. The installation process differs based on your chosen platform.

### Platform and Mode Selection

**For Claude Code users:**
| Mode | Location | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Simple Mode** (Recommended) | `claude/commands/` | Most users, one ticket at a time |
| **Worktree Mode** (Advanced) | `claude/commands-worktrees/` | Concurrent development with git worktrees |

**For OpenAI Codex users:**
| Type | Location | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Platform-Agnostic Prompts** | `codex/prompts/` | No agent references, works with any AI |

### Understanding Global vs. Local Installation

| Installation | Location | Best For |
|--------------|----------|----------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/` or `~/.codex/` | Using workflow across multiple projects |
| **Local** | `your-project/.claude/` | Keeping workflow specific to one project |

**Recommendation**: Start with **global installation** for easier management.

## Claude Code Installation

### Global Installation (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
# Go to a folder where you want to keep the source
cd ~/Documents  # or wherever you prefer

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/pm-vibecode-ops.git
cd pm-vibecode-ops
```

#### Step 2: Create Claude Config Directories

```bash
# Create the directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
```

#### Step 3: Copy Files Based on Your Mode Choice

**For Simple Mode (Recommended for beginners):**
```bash
# Copy Simple Mode commands and agents
cp claude/commands/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
cp claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/
```

**For Worktree Mode (Advanced users only):**
```bash
# Copy Worktree Mode commands and agents
cp claude/commands-worktrees/*.md ~/.claude/commands/
cp claude/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/  # Same agents for both modes
```

#### Step 4: Verify Installation

```bash
# List installed commands
ls ~/.claude/commands/
# You should see: adaptation.md, codereview.md, discovery.md, etc.

# List installed agents
ls ~/.claude/agents/
# You should see: architect_agent.md, backend_engineer_agent.md, etc.
```

### Local Installation (Project-Specific)

If you prefer to keep the workflow within a specific project:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Create local Claude directories
mkdir -p .claude/commands
mkdir -p .claude/agents

# Copy files based on your mode choice
# For Simple Mode:
cp /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/claude/commands/*.md .claude/commands/
cp /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/

# OR for Worktree Mode:
cp /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/claude/commands-worktrees/*.md .claude/commands/
cp /path/to/pm-vibecode-ops/claude/agents/*.md .claude/agents/
```

**Note**: Local installation takes precedence over global installation for that project.

## OpenAI Codex Installation

### Option 1: Reference Prompts Directly

```bash
# Clone the repository
cd ~/Documents
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ORG/pm-vibecode-ops.git

# Reference prompts directly from the cloned repository
# When using Codex, navigate to:
cd pm-vibecode-ops/codex/prompts/

# View available prompts
ls *.md
```

### Option 2: Copy to Codex Directory

```bash
# Create Codex prompt directory (if your setup uses one)
mkdir -p ~/.codex/prompts

# Copy prompts
cp pm-vibecode-ops/codex/prompts/*.md ~/.codex/prompts/

# Verify installation
ls ~/.codex/prompts/
```

### Using Codex Prompts

Unlike Claude Code's slash commands, Codex prompts are used by copying their content:

```bash
# View a prompt
cat ~/.codex/prompts/discovery.md

# Copy the content and paste into your Codex session
```

---

## Verifying Your Setup

Let's make sure everything is working.

### Checklist

Run each command and check for expected output:

```bash
# 1. Node.js installed?
node --version
# Expected: v18.x.x or higher

# 2. npm installed?
npm --version
# Expected: 9.x.x or higher

# 3. Git installed?
git --version
# Expected: git version 2.x.x

# 4. Claude Code installed?
claude --version
# Expected: Version number

# 5. Commands installed?
ls ~/.claude/commands/ | head -5
# Expected: List of .md files

# 6. Agents installed?
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | head -5
# Expected: List of .md files
```

### Test Claude Code

```bash
# Start Claude Code in a test directory
cd ~/Documents
mkdir test-setup
cd test-setup

# Initialize a git repo (required for Claude Code)
git init

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

If you see the Claude Code prompt, type:
```
/help
```

You should see available commands, including the ones you just installed.

### Clean Up Test Directory

```bash
cd ..
rm -rf test-setup
```

---

## Alternative: OpenAI Codex Setup

If you're using OpenAI's Codex instead of Claude Code, this workflow provides platform-agnostic prompts.

### Step 1: Install Codex CLI

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### Step 2: Configure OpenAI API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-key-here"
```

### Step 3: Use Platform-Agnostic Prompts

The `/codex/prompts/` directory contains prompts that work with Codex:

```bash
ls codex/prompts/
```

These prompts don't reference Claude-specific agents, making them compatible with Codex and other AI platforms.

### Using Codex Prompts

Instead of slash commands, you'll copy the prompt content and paste it into Codex:

```bash
# Read the prompt
cat codex/prompts/discovery.md

# Copy the content and use it in your Codex session
```

## Troubleshooting

### "command not found" Errors

**Problem**: `claude: command not found` or `node: command not found`

**Solutions**:
1. Close and reopen your terminal
2. Restart your computer
3. Verify the installation completed without errors
4. Check your PATH (advanced—see below)

**Checking PATH (Advanced)**:
```bash
echo $PATH
# Should include paths like /usr/local/bin or ~/.npm-global/bin
```

### Permission Denied Errors

**Problem**: `EACCES: permission denied` when installing npm packages

**Solution on Mac/Linux**:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Better long-term solution**: Configure npm to use a different directory:
```bash
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

### API Key Not Working

**Problem**: Claude Code says API key is invalid

**Solutions**:
1. Check for extra spaces when copying the key
2. Ensure the key starts with `sk-ant-`
3. Verify the key in [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
4. Check the environment variable is set:
```bash
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
# Should show your key
```

### Slash Commands Not Appearing

**Problem**: Your custom commands don't show in `/help`

**Solutions**:
1. Verify files are in the correct location:
```bash
ls ~/.claude/commands/
```
2. Check file permissions:
```bash
chmod 644 ~/.claude/commands/*.md
```
3. Restart Claude Code

### MCP Server Won't Connect

See [MCP_SETUP.md](MCP_SETUP.md) for detailed MCP troubleshooting.

### Git Errors

**Problem**: "fatal: not a git repository"

**Solution**: Initialize a git repository in your project:
```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
git init
```

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Problem**: Commands don't work in PowerShell

**Solutions**:
1. Use Windows Terminal instead of basic PowerShell
2. Run as Administrator for installation commands
3. For npm global installs, use:
```powershell
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --prefix $env:APPDATA\npm
```
