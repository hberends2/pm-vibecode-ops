## What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard protocol developed by Anthropic that enables AI applications to connect with external tools, services, and data sources through a standardized interface. Think of it like installing extensions in your browser—each MCP server gives AI assistants new capabilities.

**Without MCP servers**, Claude Code can read/write files and run terminal commands locally.

**With MCP servers**, Claude Code can:
- Create and manage Linear tickets and projects
- Search the web for current information (via Perplexity)
- Use enhanced reasoning for complex, multi-step problems
- Control a web browser for automated testing (via Playwright)
- Access remote data sources, APIs, and specialized tools

### How MCP Works

MCP uses a client-server architecture with three key components:

1. **Host**: The AI application (e.g., Claude Desktop, Claude Code, VS Code)
2. **Client**: The connector within the host that communicates via MCP protocol
3. **Server**: The service providing capabilities (tools, resources, prompts)

```
You → Claude Code (Host + Client) → MCP Server → External Service
                                          ↓
                                    Linear, Perplexity, etc.
```

MCP servers communicate using JSON-RPC message format through either:
- **stdio transport**: Local processes communicating via standard input/output (most common)
- **HTTP/SSE transport**: Remote servers accessible over the network

When you run a command like `/epic-planning`, Claude Code uses the Linear MCP server to create tickets directly in Linear through authenticated API calls.

### Platform Support

**MCP is supported by**:
- ✅ **Claude Desktop** - Official support via configuration files
- ✅ **Claude Code CLI** - Official support via `claude mcp add` command
- ✅ **VS Code** - Via MCP extension and workspace configuration
- ✅ **Cursor IDE** - Native MCP support through settings
- ✅ **OpenAI API** - Remote MCP servers via Responses API (as of November 2025)
- ✅ **Cline** - VS Code extension with MCP integration

**MCP is NOT directly supported in**:
- ❌ **Claude.ai (web interface)** - Does not support local MCP servers (use Claude Desktop or Claude Code instead)
- ❌ **ChatGPT web interface** - OpenAI only supports MCP via API, not web UI

---

## Required: Linear MCP

Linear MCP is **required** for this workflow. It allows Claude Code to create and manage issues, projects, and comments in Linear.

### Step 1: Get Your Linear API Key

1. Log in to [Linear](https://linear.app)
2. Click your profile icon (bottom left)
3. Go to **Settings** → **API**
4. Click **Create Key**
5. Give it a name like "Claude Code"
6. Copy the key (starts with `lin_api_...`)

**Important**: Save this key securely. You won't be able to see it again.

### Step 2: Set the Environment Variable

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Add to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc)
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_your_key_here"

# Reload your profile
source ~/.zshrc
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LINEAR_API_KEY", "lin_api_your_key_here", "User")
# Restart PowerShell
```

### Step 3: Install Linear MCP

**Method A: Using Claude Code CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
claude mcp add linear --scope user
```

When prompted, confirm the installation. This will automatically configure the Linear MCP server for Claude Code.

**Method B: Using Official Linear Remote Server**

Linear provides an official remote MCP server (as of 2025) that doesn't require local installation:

For Claude Desktop config:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "url": "https://mcp.linear.app/sse",
      "transport": "sse",
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Method C: Community Implementation (Alternative)**

Using the community-maintained package:
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio linear npx -y @larryhudson/linear-mcp-server
```

### Step 4: Verify Connection

```bash
# Check MCP status
claude mcp list
```

You should see `linear` in the list of active servers with status "running".

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

If automatic installation doesn't work, you can configure manually.

**Configuration file locations:**
- **Mac (Claude Desktop)**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows (Claude Desktop)**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux (Claude Desktop)**: `~/.config/claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Claude Code**: `~/.claude.json`

**For Claude Desktop (Mac/Linux):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Code (all platforms):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: After editing configuration files, you must restart Claude Desktop or Claude Code for changes to take effect.

## Recommended: Perplexity MCP

Perplexity MCP allows Claude Code to search the web for current information and perform deep research. This is valuable when:
- Researching best practices during discovery
- Looking up framework documentation
- Finding solutions to common problems
- Conducting comprehensive analysis on complex topics

### Step 1: Get Your Perplexity API Key

1. Go to [Perplexity API Platform](https://www.perplexity.ai/api-platform)
2. Create an account or log in
3. Navigate to API keys in your account settings
4. Generate an API key
5. Copy the key (starts with `pplx-`)

**Official Package**: `@perplexity-ai/mcp-server` (maintained by Perplexity AI)

### Pricing Information (as of 2025)

Perplexity uses token-based and request-based pricing:

**Search API**:
- $5.00 per 1,000 requests (no token costs)

**Sonar Models** (with token-based pricing):
- **Sonar**: $1/M input tokens, $1/M output tokens
- **Sonar Pro**: $3/M input tokens, $15/M output tokens
- **Sonar Reasoning**: $1/M input tokens, $5/M output tokens
- **Sonar Reasoning Pro**: $2/M input tokens, $8/M output tokens

**Sonar Deep Research** (comprehensive research):
- $2/M input tokens
- $8/M output tokens
- $2/M citation tokens
- $5 per 1,000 search queries
- $3/M reasoning tokens

**Typical Usage**:
- Simple search query: ~$0.006 per query
- Deep research query: ~$0.40 per query
- Typical PM workflow: $10-30/month for regular use

### Step 2: Set the Environment Variable

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-your-key-here"
```

Add to your shell profile (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) for permanence.

**On Windows:**
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "pplx-your-key-here", "User")
```

### Step 3: Install Perplexity MCP

**Using Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
claude mcp add perplexity --scope user
```

**Using official package directly:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio perplexity npx -y @perplexity-ai/mcp-server
```

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

**For Claude Desktop (Mac/Linux):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@perplexity-ai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}",
        "PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@perplexity-ai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}",
        "PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT_MS` setting (5 minutes) allows for deep research queries that take longer to complete.

## Recommended: Sequential Thinking MCP

Sequential Thinking MCP enhances Claude's reasoning for complex, multi-step problems by providing structured, iterative problem-solving capabilities. It's particularly useful during:
- Architecture planning in `/discovery`
- Complex bug analysis in `/implementation`
- Security reasoning in `/security_review`
- Multi-step technical decomposition in `/planning`

**No API key required** — this runs locally.

**Official Package**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` (maintained by Anthropic)

### How It Works

The Sequential Thinking tool enables:
- **Step-by-step reasoning**: Breaks down complex problems into manageable thoughts
- **Revision capability**: Can revise previous thoughts as understanding deepens
- **Branching**: Explore alternative reasoning paths
- **Dynamic planning**: Adjust total thought count as problem complexity becomes clear
- **Context preservation**: Maintains reasoning state across multiple steps

### Installation

**Using Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking --scope user
```

**Using official package directly:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio sequential-thinking npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking
```

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

**For Claude Desktop (Mac/Linux):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop (Windows):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Set `DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING` to `"true"` if you want to suppress thought logging for privacy or performance reasons.

---

## Optional: Playwright MCP

Playwright MCP allows Claude Code to control a web browser for automated testing, visual testing, and E2E testing. It revolutionizes browser automation by providing AI systems with semantic accessibility information rather than raw screenshots.

**Official Package**: `@playwright/mcp` (maintained by Microsoft)

### Key Capabilities

- **Browser automation**: Click, fill forms, navigate, interact with web elements
- **Accessibility-based interaction**: Uses semantic element descriptions (roles, labels) instead of screenshots
- **Test generation**: Generate automated tests from natural language descriptions
- **Visual testing**: Take screenshots and PDFs
- **Multi-browser support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
- **File upload handling**: Automate file upload scenarios

### When to Install

**Install if:**
- Your project has a web UI that needs testing
- You want automated E2E or visual regression testing
- You're building user-facing features requiring browser verification
- You need to generate test suites from requirements

**Skip if:**
- You're building backend-only services
- You don't need E2E testing
- You prefer manual browser testing exclusively

### Installation

**Using Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
claude mcp add playwright --scope user
```

**Using official package with isolated browser profile:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest -- --isolated
```

**Using persistent browser state:**
```bash
claude mcp add --transport stdio playwright npx @playwright/mcp@latest -- --isolated --storage-state=/path/to/storage.json
```

### Alternative: Manual Configuration

**For Claude Desktop (Mac/Linux) - Isolated Mode:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Claude Desktop (Windows) - Isolated Mode:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For Docker Deployment (Headless Only):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--init",
        "--pull=always",
        "mcr.microsoft.com/playwright/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### First-Time Setup

After installing Playwright MCP, you may need to install browser binaries:

```bash
# This may happen automatically, or you can run:
npx playwright install
```

**Note**: The `--isolated` flag creates a fresh browser profile for each session, ensuring clean test environments.

    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration (Windows)

**File**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@perplexity-ai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}",
        "PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000"
      }
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code Configuration (All Platforms)

**File**: `~/.claude.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "linear": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-linear"],
      "env": {
        "LINEAR_API_KEY": "${LINEAR_API_KEY}"
      }
    },
    "perplexity": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@perplexity-ai/mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "PERPLEXITY_API_KEY": "${PERPLEXITY_API_KEY}",
        "PERPLEXITY_TIMEOUT_MS": "600000"
      }
    },
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      "env": {
        "DISABLE_THOUGHT_LOGGING": "false"
      }
    },
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--isolated"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note for Windows users running Claude Code**: The Claude Code CLI handles Windows command wrapping automatically, so you don't need `cmd /c` in the `~/.claude.json` file.

### Environment Variables Setup

Create or update your shell profile with all required variables:

**Mac/Linux** (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
# Claude Code API Keys
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-anthropic-key"
export LINEAR_API_KEY="lin_api_your-linear-key"
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="pplx-your-perplexity-key"
```

**Windows** (run in PowerShell as Administrator):
```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY", "sk-ant-your-anthropic-key", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("LINEAR_API_KEY", "lin_api_your-linear-key", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PERPLEXITY_API_KEY", "pplx-your-perplexity-key", "User")
```

---

## Verification and Testing

After setting up MCP servers, verify everything works:

### Step 1: Check MCP Server Status

```bash
claude mcp list
```

Expected output:
```
Active MCP Servers:
- linear (running)
- perplexity (running)
- sequential-thinking (running)
- playwright (running)
```

### Step 2: Test Linear Connection

Start Claude Code and run:
```
Can you list my Linear teams?
```

Claude should use `mcp__linear-server__list_teams` and show your Linear teams.

### Step 3: Test Perplexity Connection

```
Search the web for "best practices for REST API design 2024"
```

Claude should use `mcp__perplexity__search` and return current information.

### Step 4: Test Sequential Thinking

```
Think through the architectural implications of adding real-time notifications to a monolithic application.
```

Claude should use `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` for structured reasoning.

---

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Won't Start

**Symptoms**: Server shows as "not running" or "error" in `claude mcp list`

**Solutions**:

1. **Check Node.js is installed**:
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
   Must be v18 or higher.

2. **Clear npx cache**:
   ```bash
   npx clear-npx-cache
   ```

3. **Try manual npx run**:
   ```bash
   npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-linear
   ```
   This should start the server. If it fails, you'll see the actual error.

4. **Check environment variables**:
   ```bash
   echo $LINEAR_API_KEY
   echo $PERPLEXITY_API_KEY
   ```
   Should show your keys, not empty strings.

### "Invalid API Key" Errors

**For Linear**:
- Verify key starts with `lin_api_`
- Check for extra spaces when copying
- Try generating a new key

**For Perplexity**:
- Verify key starts with `pplx-`
- Check your Perplexity account has API access enabled
- Verify billing is set up if on paid tier

### Windows-Specific Issues

**Problem**: MCP servers don't start on Windows

**Solution**: Ensure you're using the Windows-specific config format with `cmd /c npx`:
```json
{
  "command": "cmd",
  "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "package-name"]
}
```

**Problem**: Environment variables not recognized

**Solution**:
1. Set variables using System Properties (not just PowerShell export)
2. Restart your terminal completely
3. Verify with `echo $env:LINEAR_API_KEY` in PowerShell

### Config File Not Found

If Claude Code can't find your config:

1. **Find the correct path**:
   ```bash
   # Mac
   ls ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/

   # Linux
   ls ~/.config/claude/

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   dir $env:APPDATA\Claude\
   ```

2. **Create the directory and file if missing**:
   ```bash
   # Mac
   mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude
   touch ~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
   ```

### Servers Disconnect Randomly

**Cause**: Network issues or server timeouts

**Solutions**:
1. Restart Claude Code
2. Check your internet connection
3. Verify API keys haven't expired
4. Try reinstalling the problematic server:
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove linear
   claude mcp add linear --scope user
   ```

---

## Security Best Practices

### API Key Safety

1. **Never commit keys to git**:
   - Add `.env` to `.gitignore`
   - Use environment variables, not hardcoded values

2. **Use scoped keys when possible**:
   - Linear keys can be scoped to specific teams
   - Create dedicated keys for Claude Code

3. **Rotate keys periodically**:
   - Every 90 days for production use
   - Immediately if you suspect exposure

### Principle of Least Privilege

Only install the MCP servers you need:
- **Always needed**: Linear
- **Usually helpful**: Perplexity, Sequential Thinking
- **Only if needed**: Playwright

### Audit Usage

Periodically review:
- Linear API key usage in Linear settings
- Perplexity API costs in your account

---

## Next Steps

With MCP servers configured:

1. **Return to the main guide** — See [PM_GUIDE.md](../PM_GUIDE.md) for workflow instructions

2. **Run your first discovery** — Test that Linear integration works

3. **Review troubleshooting** — See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) if you encounter issues

---

## MCP Architecture and Transport Types

### Transport Mechanisms

MCP servers communicate via two main transport types:

#### stdio Transport (Most Common)
- **How it works**: MCP server runs as a local process, communicating via standard input/output
- **Best for**: Local tools, filesystem access, local databases
- **Security**: Process is isolated to the client that launched it
- **Example**: Sequential Thinking, local Linear MCP server

#### HTTP/SSE Transport
- **How it works**: MCP server runs as a remote HTTP endpoint with Server-Sent Events
- **Best for**: Remote services, shared resources, cloud-hosted tools
- **Security**: Requires authentication (typically OAuth 2.1 or Bearer tokens)
- **Example**: Linear official remote server (mcp.linear.app/sse)

### Configuration Hierarchy

MCP configuration follows a priority order (highest to lowest):

1. **Enterprise managed policies**: `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/managed-mcp.json` (Mac) or `C:\ProgramData\ClaudeCode\managed-mcp.json` (Windows)
2. **Command-line arguments**: Temporary overrides for specific sessions
3. **Local project settings**: `.claude/settings.local.json` (per-machine within project)
4. **Shared project settings**: `.claude/settings.json` (team-wide, version controlled)
5. **User settings**: `~/.claude/settings.json` or `~/.claude.json` (personal defaults)

More specific configurations always override global defaults.
