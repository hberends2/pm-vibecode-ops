## Key Concepts

| Term | What It Means | Why You Care |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| **Service Inventory** | List of existing code | Prevents rebuilding what exists |
| **Discovery** | AI learns your codebase | Ensures new code matches patterns |
| **Adaptation** | Implementation plan | Maximizes code reuse |
| **Skills** | Auto-activated quality rules | Enforces standards during development |
| **Quality Gates** | Automated checks | Ensures production-ready code |

## PRD Essentials

Your PRD must include:

1. **Problem Statement** - Why does this matter?
2. **User Personas** - Who benefits?
3. **Success Criteria** - How do we measure?
4. **User Stories** - What can users do?
5. **Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, testable requirements
6. **Scope** - What's in/out of v1?

## When Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Tests failing | Clarify acceptance criteria, let AI fix |
| Security CRITICAL | Must fix before merge, describe issue to AI |
| Implementation wrong | Describe what's wrong (not how to fix) |
| Duplicate epics | Re-run with service inventory first |
| Branch not found | Run `/adaptation` first |

---

## Success Metrics to Track

- **Velocity**: Time from PRD to production (target: 50% reduction)
- **Quality**: Test coverage (target: 90%+)
- **Reuse**: Service reuse rate (target: 70%+)
- **Security**: Critical issues found pre-production (target: 100%)
