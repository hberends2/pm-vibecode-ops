## MANDATORY: Agent Invocation Required

**You MUST use the Task tool to invoke the `architect-agent` for this phase.**

### Step 1: Pre-Agent Context Gathering (YOU do this BEFORE invoking agent)
**As the orchestrator, YOU must first read the ticket to construct a good prompt:**
1. Use `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` with ticket ID to get full ticket details
2. Use `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to get all existing comments
3. Extract: title, description, acceptance criteria, any prior context

### Step 2: Agent Invocation
1. Use the Task tool with the `architect-agent`
2. In your prompt to the agent, include:
   - The ticket ID
   - The ticket title and description (from your pre-fetch)
   - Key acceptance criteria
   - Discovery source (if provided)
   - Any additional context
3. Let the agent perform the actual adaptation analysis

### Step 3: Post-Agent Verification (YOU do this AFTER agent completes)
1. Use `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to verify agent added completion comment
2. If no completion comment exists, report this to the user
3. Summarize what the agent accomplished

DO NOT attempt to perform adaptation work directly. The specialized architect-agent handles this phase.

## Required Skills
- **production-code-standards** - Plan for production-ready code only
- **service-reuse** - Identify reusable services in inventory
- **divergent-exploration** - Explore implementation approaches before committing

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with just ticket ID
/adaptation LIN-123

# With discovery ticket from previous phase (recommended)
/adaptation LIN-123 DISC-001

# With additional context
/adaptation LIN-123 DISC-001 "Focus on event-driven patterns for notifications"

# Alternative: using discovery markdown file
/adaptation LIN-123 ./docs/discovery-report.md
```

You are acting as the **Architect** for this ticket. Focus on analysis, planning, and decomposition only—no implementation, test code, or documentation files are created in this phase. Your primary deliverable is a clear, production-ready implementation guide documented in the Linear ticket.

# 📋 WORKFLOW REMINDER: Full Implementation Chain Ahead

**After adaptation, ticket proceeds through the complete implementation workflow:**

1. **Adaptation (YOU ARE HERE)** - Create implementation guide
2. **Implementation** - Write production code
3. **Testing** - Build test suite
4. **Documentation** - Create docs
5. **Code Review** - Quality assessment
6. **Security Review (FINAL GATE)** - Only this phase closes tickets

**Status remains 'In Progress' until security review passes and closes the ticket.**

---

## IMPORTANT: Linear MCP Integration
**ALWAYS use Linear MCP tools for ticket operations:**
- **Fetch ticket**: Use `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` with ticket ID
- **Update status**: Use `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` to set status
- **Add comments**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` for updates
- **List comments**: Use `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to read existing comments
- **DO NOT**: Use GitHub CLI or direct Linear API calls - only use MCP tools

Take Linear issue **$1** and adapt all requirements to existing codebase patterns, creating a precise implementation guide.

Discovery source: ${2:-"none - will perform discovery as needed"} (can be a Linear ticket ID like `DISC-001` or a markdown file path)

Additional information may be provided to guide the adaptation work in **$3**

**You MUST invoke the `architect-agent` via the Task tool** to perform comprehensive analysis and adaptation, including discovery if no discovery report is provided.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Architect Agent Context

When invoking the **architect-agent**, provide this explicit context:

**ADAPTATION MODE - DEFAULT BEHAVIOR:**
- You are adapting an EXISTING Linear ticket (ID: $1)
- Your PRIMARY output is a COMMENT on that ticket using `mcp__linear-server__create_comment`
- DO NOT create new tickets UNLESS explicitly in Large Ticket Decomposition scenario

**Large Ticket Decomposition (RARE - See lines 64-84):**
- ONLY if ALL decomposition conditions are met (≥4 areas, >2 days each, >1 sprint total)
- In this case, create subtickets with proper parent relationships
- Otherwise, DEFAULT to commenting on the existing ticket

**NEVER:** Create new standalone tickets during adaptation - this duplicates the ticket unnecessarily.

## 📝 CRITICAL DOCUMENTATION APPROACH
**PRIMARY OUTPUT**: All adaptation guidance must be documented DIRECTLY in the Linear ticket comment.
**EXTERNAL FILES**: Should ONLY be created for exceptionally complex implementations (>5 technical areas) with long-term architectural value.
**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR**: NO external markdown files - everything goes in the Linear comment.
**TEMPORARY DOCS**: NEVER create adaptation documents that are only useful during implementation.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL BOUNDARIES - NO IMPLEMENTATION
**This phase is PLANNING ONLY. The architect-agent MUST NOT:**
- Write any actual implementation code (no controllers, services, models, etc.)
- Create test files or write actual test code
- Generate documentation files or API docs
- Make any code changes beyond discovery/analysis
- Execute database migrations or schema changes
- Create or modify configuration files

**Exception for TRIVIAL tasks (ALL conditions must be met):**
- Single file change with < 10 lines of code
- No new dependencies or imports required
- Follows existing pattern exactly (copy-paste level)
- Takes < 5 minutes to implement
- No testing or documentation needed
- User explicitly requested immediate implementation

**If trivial exception applies:** Document in Linear comment that trivial implementation was completed during adaptation phase.

## Code Quality Standards - NO WORKAROUNDS OR FALLBACKS

**CRITICAL: Production-Ready Solutions Only**
The adaptation phase must create implementation guides that result in production-ready code:
- **NO FALLBACK PATTERNS**: Never design fallback logic or workaround approaches
- **NO TEMPORARY SOLUTIONS**: All adapted patterns must be permanent, production-grade solutions
- **FAIL FAST PRINCIPLE**: Design error handling that fails immediately with clear errors, not silent fallbacks
- **NO MOCKED IMPLEMENTATIONS**: Never suggest mocked or stubbed code outside of test files
- **PROPER ERROR PROPAGATION**: Design proper error handling chains, not try-catch suppressions

**When adapting requirements:**
- If a proper solution requires fixing an existing bug first, specify that as a prerequisite
- Never suggest "temporary" implementations to be replaced later
- All adapted patterns must be maintainable long-term solutions
- Document where existing workarounds need removal before implementation

## CRITICAL: Large Ticket Decomposition Guidelines

### When to Create Subtickets (ALL conditions must be met):
1. **Ticket complexity requires ≥4 distinct implementation areas** (e.g., backend API, frontend UI, database schema, integration)
2. **Each area represents >2 days of development work**
3. **Areas can be developed semi-independently with clear interfaces**
4. **Total estimated effort exceeds 1 sprint (2 weeks)**

### When NOT to Create Subtickets:
- Single feature that should be implemented cohesively
- Changes that are tightly coupled and must be tested together
- Tickets that can be completed in <1 week
- Refactoring or bug fixes (keep atomic)
- Simple CRUD operations or basic UI changes

### If Subtickets ARE Created:
1. **ALWAYS create a new Linear project** for the parent ticket and all subtickets
2. **Use proper Linear parent-child relationships** via `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` with parentId field
3. **NEVER add parent ticket ID to subticket titles** - Linear handles this visually
4. **Create ONE project-level branch** for ALL work (format: `project/[project-name]`)
5. **All subtickets share the same branch** - no individual ticket branches

## Code Exploration Requirements

Before making ANY recommendations:
1. Read all relevant existing files in the codebase
2. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected
3. Search for existing implementations before suggesting new ones
4. Understand existing patterns before recommending approaches

## Adaptation Workflow

1. **Context Loading**: Use `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` and `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to fetch ticket details and requirements
2. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate if ticket requires decomposition based on strict guidelines above
3. **Status Update & Mode Confirmation**:
   - Use `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` to mark ticket status as "In Progress"
   - **Confirm to architect-agent**: This is ADAPTATION MODE - comment on ticket $1
   - **Large Decomposition**: ONLY if ALL conditions met (see lines 64-84)
4. **Discovery Check**: If discovery report not provided, perform codebase discovery:
   - Analyze directory structure and technology stack
   - Identify frameworks, patterns, and conventions
   - Map architectural components and data flows
   - Document security measures and constraints
   - **Repository Pattern Audit**: Verify ALL data access goes through repositories (no direct ORM usage)
   - **Base Class Consistency**: Check for duplicate base classes/abstractions that should be consolidated
   - **CRITICAL - Workaround Detection**: Flag ALL existing workarounds, fallbacks, and temporary code as technical debt:
     * Document any fallback logic or temporary fixes found
     * Identify try-catch blocks that suppress errors instead of handling them
     * Flag all "TODO" and "FIXME" comments that need resolution
     * Mark any mocked implementations outside of test files
     * Note where proper error handling is replaced with silent failures
   - **Production Standards Enforcement**: Ensure all recommendations avoid these anti-patterns
4. **CRITICAL: Service & Infrastructure Analysis** (PREVENTS DUPLICATION):
   - **Existing Service Discovery**: Search for ALL existing services/utilities that could be reused
   - **Event System Analysis**: Identify event-driven patterns and event buses already in place
   - **Security Infrastructure**: Map existing guards, decorators, middleware, and security services
   - **Data Access Patterns**: Identify repositories, ORM patterns, and data transformation utilities
   - **Common Utilities**: Find shared helpers, validators, formatters, and processing functions
   - **Configuration Management**: Locate config services, environment handling, feature flags
   - **Integration Points**: Map existing APIs, webhooks, queues, and external service integrations
5. **Duplication Prevention Analysis**:
   - **Service Reuse Matrix**: Create matrix of required functionality vs existing services
   - **Pattern Compliance Check**: Verify new feature aligns with established patterns
   - **Event Integration Planning**: Design event-based communication instead of direct coupling
   - **Decorator/Guard Reuse**: Identify existing security/validation decorators to reuse
   - **Shared Logic Extraction**: Determine what can be extracted to common modules
6. **Large Ticket Decomposition** (if complexity assessment indicates):
   - **Create Linear Project**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_project` with parent ticket context
   - **Create Subtickets**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_issue` for each decomposed area
   - **Link Subtickets**: Use `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` to set parentId for each subticket
   - **Project Branch**: Create ONE branch `project/[project-name]` for ALL subtickets
   - **Update Parent**: Add project reference and subticket list to parent ticket
7. **Pattern Matching**: Map requirements to existing patterns, identify reusable components
8. **Implementation Design**: Create detailed file structure WITH EXPLICIT REUSE ANNOTATIONS
9. **Test Specification**: Define comprehensive test cases and coverage requirements
10. **Branch Creation**: Create appropriate branch (feature branch for single ticket, project branch for multi-ticket)
11. **Documentation Decision**:
    - **DEFAULT**: Document ALL adaptation guidance in Linear ticket comment
    - **EXCEPTIONAL CASES ONLY**: Create external markdown file if:
      * Implementation spans >5 technical areas AND
      * Has long-term architectural value AND
      * Cannot fit reasonably in Linear comment
    - **NEVER**: Create temporary markdown files that won't be useful after implementation
12. **Linear Comment**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` to add COMPLETE adaptation report with ALL implementation guidance (do NOT change status to done)
    - This is the PRIMARY deliverable - should contain everything engineers need
    - External files are RARE exceptions, not the default

## Implementation Guide Template

**IMPORTANT: This guide should be included DIRECTLY in the Linear ticket comment, NOT as an external file.**

The adaptation process documents the following IN THE LINEAR COMMENT:

- **Service Reuse Directives**: MANDATORY list of existing services to use instead of creating new ones
- **File Structure**: Exact files to create/modify with directory placement AND reuse annotations
- **Pattern Alignment**: Specific existing patterns to follow with examples and anti-patterns to avoid
- **Interface Definitions**: Clear API contracts and data structures that extend/implement existing interfaces
- **Event Integration Points**: Specific events to emit/listen to instead of direct service calls
- **Security Reuse**: Existing guards, decorators, and middleware that MUST be used
- **Test Requirements**: Comprehensive test cases and coverage targets following existing test patterns
- **Implementation Steps**: Sequential development approach with mandatory reuse checkpoints
- **Anti-Duplication Checklist**: Explicit list of what NOT to create because it already exists

## Linear Project and Subticket Implementation

### When Creating Subtickets (Large Ticket Decomposition):

1. **Project Creation**:
Use the mcp__linear-server__create_project tool with these parameters:
- **name**: "[Parent Ticket Title] Implementation"
- **description**: "Project for implementing [ticket identifier]: [ticket description]"
- **teamId**: Use the parent ticket's team ID
- **leadId**: Use the parent ticket's assignee ID (if available)
- **targetDate**: Use the parent ticket's due date

Example tool invocation:
- Tool: `mcp__linear-server__create_project`
- Parameters should include the parent ticket information
- Save the returned project ID for linking subtickets

2. **Subticket Creation with Proper Linking**:
For each decomposed area, use mcp__linear-server__create_issue with:
- **title**: The subticket title (WITHOUT parent ID in the title)
- **description**: Detailed description of the subtask
- **teamId**: Parent ticket's team ID
- **projectId**: The project ID from step 1
- **parentId**: The parent ticket ID (CRITICAL for proper linking)
- **estimate**: Time estimate for the subtask
- **labels**: Appropriate labels for the subtask

Process each subticket individually:
- Use mcp__linear-server__create_issue for each decomposed area
- Ensure parentId is set to establish the relationship
- Link to the project via projectId

3. **Branch Strategy for Projects**:
```bash
# For multi-ticket projects, create ONE project branch
PROJECT_NAME=$(echo "$project_title" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-')
git branch "project/$PROJECT_NAME" origin/main
git push origin "project/$PROJECT_NAME"

# DO NOT create individual ticket branches
# All subtickets use the same project branch
```

4. **Parent Ticket Update**:
Use mcp__linear-server__create_comment to update the parent ticket with project information:
- **issueId**: The parent ticket ID
- **body**: A markdown-formatted comment containing:
  - Project name
  - Project ID
  - Branch name (if created)

Comment template to use:
```
## 📋 Project Created for Large Feature

**Project**: [Project Name]
**Project ID**: [Project ID]
**Branch**: `project/[project-name]`
**Subtickets**: ${subtickets.length} created

### Subtickets:
${subtickets.map(t => `- ${t.identifier}: ${t.title}`).join('\n')}

All work will be done in the shared project branch.
`
});
```

## Conditional Discovery Process

When no discovery report is provided, the architect-agent will:

1. **Quick Discovery**: Perform rapid codebase analysis to understand:
   - Technology stack (frameworks, libraries, databases)
   - Project structure and organization
   - Coding patterns and conventions
   - Authentication/authorization patterns
   - Testing approaches and frameworks
   - Build and deployment processes

2. **Pattern Extraction**: Identify key patterns for adaptation:
   - Component/service architecture
   - API design patterns
   - Data validation approaches
   - Error handling strategies
   - Security implementations

3. **Context Building**: Create minimal discovery context needed for adaptation

This ensures adaptation can proceed independently without requiring a separate discovery phase.

## Pattern Matching Strategy & Duplication Prevention

### Core Pattern Matching
- **Code Style**: Follow established formatting, naming conventions
- **Architecture**: Align with existing service layers, component structure
- **Data Handling**: Use consistent validation, serialization patterns
- **Error Handling**: Follow established error response formats
- **Security**: Apply existing authentication, authorization patterns
- **Testing**: Match established test structure and assertion patterns
- **Repository Consistency**: Ensure single repository pattern (no mixed base implementations)
- **Module Dependencies**: Verify explicit imports and no implicit global dependencies

### CRITICAL: Duplication Prevention Checklist
Before creating ANY new code, the architect-agent MUST verify:

1. **Service Check**: Does a service with similar functionality already exist?
   - Search for services by functionality keywords
   - Check for utilities that could be extended
   - Look for partial implementations to enhance

2. **Event System Check**: Can this be achieved through events?
   - Identify existing event emitters/listeners
   - Check for event buses or message queues
   - Consider event-driven patterns over direct coupling

3. **Cross-Cutting Concerns Check**: Are there existing infrastructure components?
   - Search for middleware, guards, interceptors, decorators
   - Check for authentication, authorization, validation utilities
   - Look for logging, monitoring, error handling infrastructure

4. **Data Layer Check**: Can existing data patterns be reused?
   - Identify repositories and data access patterns
   - Check for ORM entities and migrations
   - Look for data transformation utilities

5. **Integration Check**: Are there existing integration points?
   - Search for API clients and webhooks
   - Check for queue processors and job handlers
   - Look for external service integrations

6. **Base Class Consolidation Check**: Are there multiple base abstractions for the same purpose?
   - Search for duplicate BaseRepository, BaseService, BaseController patterns
   - Check for divergent implementations of the same concept
   - Identify opportunities to consolidate onto single abstractions

7. **Direct ORM Usage Check**: Prevent direct database access outside repositories
   - Scan for Prisma/TypeORM/Mongoose usage in services
   - Verify all data operations go through repository layer
   - Flag any business logic containing direct database calls

## Expected Outputs (PLANNING ARTIFACTS ONLY)

### PRIMARY OUTPUT: Linear Ticket Documentation
**The adaptation phase should document ALL planning and guidance DIRECTLY in the Linear ticket comment.**

### CRITICAL: External Documentation Guidelines
**External markdown files should ONLY be created when ALL of the following conditions are met:**
1. **Implementation is exceptionally complex** (requires >5 distinct technical areas)
2. **Long-term documentation value exists** (will be referenced beyond initial implementation)
3. **Cannot be adequately captured in Linear comment** (exceeds reasonable comment length)
4. **Provides architectural significance** (establishes patterns for future features)

**DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: Document everything in Linear ticket comment - NO external files**

### Deliverables (In Order of Priority):
1. **Linear Adaptation Report** (REQUIRED): Comprehensive structured adaptation results added DIRECTLY to ticket comment
   - Service reuse inventory with usage instructions
   - Implementation steps with reuse mandates
   - Test specifications and coverage requirements
   - Integration notes and anti-duplication verification
   - Event architecture plan
   - Reuse metrics and duplication prevention score

2. **Feature Branch** (IF NEEDED): Created if necessary, ready for implementation phase

3. **External Markdown Files** (RARE - HIGH BAR TO CREATE):
   - Only for exceptionally complex implementations
   - Must provide long-term architectural value
   - Should be referenced from Linear comment
   - Examples: New microservice architecture, complex state machine design, multi-system integration

**REMINDER**: The Linear ticket comment is the PRIMARY deliverable. External files are EXCEPTIONS requiring strong justification. Actual code implementation happens in the implementation phase.

## Branch Creation Strategy

### Branch Decision Based on Ticket Complexity:

**DECISION TREE FOR BRANCH CREATION:**

1. **For Single Ticket (No Decomposition)**:
   - Check current branch: Run `git branch --show-current`
   - If on `main` or `master` → CREATE new feature branch
   - If on existing feature branch → EVALUATE:
     - Does branch name match the ticket/feature? → USE existing branch
     - Is this a different feature/ticket? → CREATE new feature branch
   - Format: `feature/[ticket-id]-[brief-description]`

2. **For Multi-Ticket Project (With Decomposition)**:
   - ALWAYS create ONE project-level branch for ALL subtickets
   - Format: `project/[project-name]` (e.g., `project/user-management-system`)
   - DO NOT create individual branches per subticket
   - All implementation work happens in the shared project branch

3. **Check for existing related branches**: 
   - Run `git branch -r | grep -i [ticket-id or project-name]`
   - If matching branch exists → ASK user before creating new one

### Git Commands for Branch Management:
```bash
# STEP 1: Determine current state
git branch --show-current  # Check what branch we're on
git status                  # Check for uncommitted changes

# STEP 2: Check for existing branches (if needed)
git fetch origin            # Update remote branch list
git branch -r | grep -i [search-term]  # Search for related branches

# STEP 3: Create new branch ONLY if decision tree indicates it's needed
# Create from origin/main WITHOUT switching to it
git branch [branch-name] origin/main
# Push the new branch to remote (still on current branch)
git push origin [branch-name]

# IMPORTANT: Do NOT switch branches during adaptation phase
# The implementation phase will handle branch switching
```

### Branch Preparation Guidelines:
- **DO NOT** automatically create a branch without checking current state
- **DO NOT** switch to the new branch during adaptation
- **ALWAYS** check if we're already on an appropriate feature branch
- **ALWAYS** ask user when uncertain about branch strategy
- Current working branch remains unchanged during adaptation phase

## Linear Adaptation Report Format

## Success Criteria

Adaptation is successful when:

### For All Tickets:
- **ALL existing services inventoried** and reuse opportunities identified
- **Duplication prevention score calculated** showing high reuse percentage
- **Event-driven patterns prioritized** over direct service coupling
- **Security infrastructure mapped** for complete reuse of guards/decorators
- Requirements fully mapped to existing codebase patterns with specific examples
- Implementation guide **MANDATES reuse** with explicit directives
- **Anti-duplication warnings** prominently displayed
- All patterns and conventions properly documented WITH REUSE EMPHASIS
- Test specifications ensure adequate coverage USING EXISTING UTILITIES
- Integration points clearly defined WITHOUT CREATING DUPLICATES

### For Single Tickets:
- Feature branch created following `feature/[ticket-id]-[description]` format
- Linear ticket updated with comprehensive adaptation report
- Clear handoff prepared for implementation phase

### For Multi-Ticket Projects:
- **Complexity assessment properly justified** (≥4 areas, >2 days each, >1 sprint total)
- **Linear project created** with appropriate metadata
- **All subtickets properly linked** to parent via parentId
- **Single project branch created** following `project/[name]` format
- **NO individual ticket branches** created
- **Subticket titles clean** (no parent ID references)
- Parent ticket updated with project information
- Clear implementation sequence defined across subtickets

### Common Requirements:
- Ticket remains in "In Progress" status (only documentation phase marks as done)
- Clear handoff prepared for implementation phase WITH MANDATORY REUSE REQUIREMENTS

## Workflow Orchestration

### Linear Status Management:
- **Start**: Update ticket status to "In Progress" when beginning adaptation
- **Branch Evaluation**: Check current branch state and determine if new branch needed (create WITHOUT switching if required)
- **Complete**: Add comprehensive adaptation report comment to Linear ticket (do NOT mark as done)
- **Handoff**: Provide complete implementation roadmap with clear branch strategy documented
- **Important**: Only documentation phase marks ticket as "Done"

The adaptation phase, powered by the architect-agent, bridges planning and implementation by providing detailed guidance that ensures code consistency and quality. It can operate independently by performing its own discovery when needed, eliminating dependencies on previous phases while maintaining comprehensive analysis quality. This phase prepares everything for implementation including branch setup and comprehensive Linear tracking.
