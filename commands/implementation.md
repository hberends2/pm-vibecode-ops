## MANDATORY: Agent Invocation Required

**You MUST use the Task tool to invoke the appropriate engineer agent for this phase.**

Based on the type of work required:
- **Backend work**: Use the Task tool with the `backend-engineer-agent`
- **Frontend work**: Use the Task tool with the `frontend-engineer-agent`
- **Full-stack work**: Invoke both agents as needed for their respective domains

### Step 1: Pre-Agent Context Gathering (YOU do this BEFORE invoking agent)

**As the orchestrator, YOU must gather ALL context before spawning the agent:**

1. **Fetch ticket details**: Use `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` with ticket ID
2. **Fetch all comments**: Use `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` to get complete history
3. **Extract and prepare the following for the agent prompt:**
   - Ticket ID, title, and full description
   - The adaptation report (CRITICAL - this is the implementation guide!)
   - Acceptance criteria and requirements
   - Any blockers or issues mentioned
4. **Determine work type**: Backend, frontend, or full-stack based on adaptation report
5. **Get git context**: Run `git status` and `git branch --show-current`

**IMPORTANT**: The agent does NOT have access to Linear. You must include ALL relevant context in the prompt.

### Step 2: Agent Invocation (Provide Full Context)

Use the Task tool to invoke the appropriate engineer agent with ALL context embedded:

**Your prompt to the agent MUST include:**
- The ticket ID for reference
- The full ticket title and description (copy the text)
- The complete adaptation report (copy from comments - this is critical!)
- Git status and current branch information
- Any service reuse mandates from adaptation

**Example prompt structure:**
```
## Ticket Context
**ID**: [ticket-id]
**Title**: [title from get_issue]
**Description**:
[full description text from get_issue]

## Adaptation Report (Implementation Guide)
[paste the full adaptation report from list_comments]

## Service Reuse Mandates
[list any services that MUST be reused from adaptation report]

## Current State
**Branch**: [current branch name]
**Git Status**: [clean/uncommitted changes]

## Your Task
Implement the functionality for this ticket following the adaptation guide. Return a structured implementation report when complete, including:
- Files created/modified
- Services reused
- Implementation decisions made
```

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT tell the agent to "fetch the ticket" or "read comments" - the agent cannot access Linear.

### Step 3: Post-Agent Completion (YOU Write to Linear)

After the agent returns its report:

1. **Parse the agent's report** - Extract files changed, services used, implementation details
2. **Write the completion comment** - Use `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` with the structured implementation report
3. **Update ticket status if needed** - Use `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` (keep as "In Progress")
4. **Verify success** - Confirm the comment was added
5. **Report to user** - Summarize what was completed (files, PR if created, next steps)

**YOU are responsible for the Linear comment, not the agent.**

DO NOT attempt to write implementation code directly. The specialized engineer agents handle the coding.

---

## Required Skills
Before implementation, ensure these skills are active:
- **production-code-standards** - All code must be production-ready, no workarounds
- **service-reuse** - Check inventory before creating new services
- **security-patterns** - Apply OWASP patterns to security-relevant code

## Usage Examples

```bash
# Basic usage with just ticket ID
/implementation LIN-456
```

You are acting as a **Backend and Frontend Implementation Engineer** for this ticket. Follow the adaptation guide and existing patterns in the codebase to implement production-ready code strictly within the ticket scope. Do not change behavior outside the documented requirements.

# ⚠️ NEXT STEP: After Implementation Completes, Ticket Proceeds to Testing

**Implementation runs AFTER adaptation and BEFORE testing.**

- When implementation completes, ticket proceeds to `/testing` command
- Then: Testing → Documentation → Code Review → Security Review (final gate that closes ticket)
- Status remains 'In Progress' throughout implementation phase

**Workflow Position:** `Adaptation → Implementation (YOU ARE HERE) → Testing → Documentation → Code Review → Security Review (closes ticket)`

---

## Pre-flight Checks
Before running:
- [ ] Linear MCP connected
- [ ] Ticket exists and is assigned
- [ ] Adaptation phase completed for this ticket
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Working directory is clean (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes)

## IMPORTANT: Linear MCP Integration (Orchestrator Responsibility)

**The orchestrator (YOU) handles ALL Linear MCP operations. The agent does NOT have access to Linear.**

**Tools you will use:**
- **Fetch ticket**: `mcp__linear-server__get_issue` - YOU fetch before agent invocation
- **Fetch comments**: `mcp__linear-server__list_comments` - YOU fetch before agent invocation (adaptation report is here!)
- **Add comments**: `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` - YOU write after agent returns
- **Update status**: `mcp__linear-server__update_issue` - YOU update after agent returns

Execute the actual code implementation for ticket **$1** based on the adaptation guide from the previous phase.

Adaptation guide: **$2** (implementation instructions)

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Orchestrator-Agent Responsibility Split

**ORCHESTRATOR (YOU) is responsible for:**
- Fetching ticket details and ALL comments BEFORE invoking agent
- Finding and extracting the adaptation report from comments
- Embedding ALL context (ticket + adaptation report) into the agent prompt
- Writing the implementation report to Linear AFTER agent completes
- Managing PR creation and Linear status updates

**AGENT (backend/frontend-engineer-agent) is responsible for:**
- Reading the implementation guide (from context you provide)
- Writing production-ready code following patterns
- Verifying service reuse compliance
- Returning a structured implementation report

**CRITICAL SCOPE BOUNDARIES**:
- Implement ONLY what is required to fulfill the ticket requirements
- Do NOT implement test code (testing phase handles this)
- Do NOT fix unrelated linting or type errors outside of ticket scope
- Stay strictly within the boundaries defined by the ticket and adaptation report

## Branch Management

### Branch Strategy from Adaptation Phase:
The adaptation phase has already determined the branch strategy. Check the adaptation report to understand:
- Whether a new branch was created
- Whether we're using an existing feature branch
- Whether we stayed on the current branch

### Switching to Implementation Branch:
```bash
# STEP 1: Check current branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $current_branch"

# STEP 2: Review adaptation report for branch strategy
# The adaptation phase should have documented:
# - Branch name if created new
# - Existing branch name if reusing
# - Current branch if no change needed

# STEP 3: Switch to the designated branch (if different from current)
# Example: If adaptation created feature/LIN-123-user-auth
git checkout [branch-name-from-adaptation]

# If branch exists on remote but not locally
git checkout -b [branch-name] origin/[branch-name]

# FALLBACK: If adaptation didn't create a branch (error case)
# Check with user before creating
echo "No feature branch found. Should I create one? (Ask user for branch name)"
```

**Important**: Use the branch strategy documented in the adaptation phase. Do NOT create additional branches.

## Branch Safety Check

Before making ANY commits, verify you're on the correct branch:
```bash
# Check current branch
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current)
echo "Current branch: $current_branch"

# CRITICAL: Verify NOT on main/master
if [[ "$current_branch" == "main" ]] || [[ "$current_branch" == "master" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: On main branch! Switch to feature branch first"
    echo "Check adaptation report for designated branch name"
    exit 1
fi

# Verify on a feature branch (common patterns)
if [[ "$current_branch" =~ ^(feature|feat|fix|hotfix|bugfix)/ ]] || \
   [[ "$current_branch" =~ ^[A-Z]+-[0-9]+ ]]; then
    echo "✓ On feature branch: $current_branch"
else
    echo "WARNING: Branch name '$current_branch' doesn't follow common patterns"
    echo "Confirm this is the correct implementation branch from adaptation phase"
fi
```

## Code Quality Standards - NO WORKAROUNDS OR FALLBACKS

**CRITICAL: Production-Ready Code Only**
During implementation, the agent MUST deliver production-quality code:
- **NO FALLBACK LOGIC**: Never implement fallback behavior or workarounds
- **NO TEMPORARY CODE**: All code must be permanent, production-ready solutions
- **FAIL FAST PRINCIPLE**: Implement proper error handling that fails immediately with clear errors
- **NO MOCKED IMPLEMENTATIONS**: Never use mocked or stubbed code except in test files
- **NO TODO COMMENTS**: Complete all functionality - no "TODO: implement later" comments
- **PROPER ERROR HANDLING**: Throw meaningful errors, never suppress with empty catch blocks

**Error Handling Requirements:**
- Validate inputs and fail immediately if invalid
- Throw specific, meaningful error types
- Let errors propagate to proper handlers
- Never use try-catch to suppress errors silently
- If an external dependency fails, let it fail properly

**If blocked by an existing bug:**
- Stop implementation and report the blocking issue
- Do NOT work around the bug with temporary code
- Document the exact fix needed as a prerequisite
- Create a separate ticket for the blocking bug if needed

## Code Exploration Before Changes

Before proposing ANY code changes:
1. Read all files mentioned in the adaptation guide
2. Read files imported/referenced by those files
3. Understand existing patterns before writing new code
4. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected

## Pre-Implementation Validation (MANDATORY)

### CRITICAL: Service Reuse Verification
Before writing ANY new code, validate the adaptation guide against the service inventory:

```bash
# Check for service inventory from discovery phase
if [ -f "context/service-inventory.yaml" ]; then
    echo "✓ Service inventory found - validating reuse directives"
else
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: No service inventory found - risk of duplication!"
    echo "Run discovery phase first or manually verify no duplication will occur"
fi
```

### Duplication Prevention Checklist
The implementation MUST verify:
1. **Service Reuse Compliance**: All services marked for reuse in adaptation are being used
2. **No Recreation**: Confirm NOT creating functionality that exists in service inventory
3. **Event Pattern Usage**: Using events/messaging where specified in adaptation
4. **Infrastructure Reuse**: Using existing middleware/guards/decorators as directed
5. **Repository Pattern Compliance**: Using repositories NOT direct ORM calls
6. **Base Class Consistency**: Using the designated base abstractions only

### Implementation Validation Process

Before implementing, perform these validation checks using available tools:

#### Step 1: Verify Service Inventory Exists
```bash
# Check for service inventory from discovery phase
if [ -f "context/service-inventory.yaml" ]; then
    echo "✓ Service inventory found"
    # Use Read tool to examine the inventory
else
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: No service inventory found - risk of duplication!"
    echo "Run discovery phase first or manually verify no duplication"
fi
```

#### Step 2: Validate Against Adaptation Guide
Use the Read tool to examine the adaptation guide and verify:

1. **Service Reuse Compliance**
   - Read adaptation guide to identify mandated services
   - Use Grep tool to search for existing service usage
   - Document any services that MUST be reused

2. **Duplication Prevention Check**
   - Use Grep to search for similar functionality in codebase
   - Check service inventory for existing implementations
   - Flag any potential duplications found

3. **Event Pattern Verification**
   - Search for existing event emitters/listeners with Grep
   - Verify event patterns specified in adaptation guide
   - Ensure events will be used instead of direct coupling

4. **Infrastructure Compliance**
   - Use Glob to find existing guards/middleware/decorators
   - Verify adaptation guide specifies which to reuse
   - Document infrastructure components that must be applied

#### Step 3: Create Validation Report
Document findings in a validation checklist:
```bash
# Create validation report
echo "## Pre-Implementation Validation Report" > validation-report.md
echo "Date: $(date)" >> validation-report.md
echo "" >> validation-report.md
echo "### Service Reuse Checklist" >> validation-report.md
echo "- [ ] Service inventory consulted" >> validation-report.md
echo "- [ ] Mandated services identified" >> validation-report.md
echo "- [ ] No duplication detected" >> validation-report.md
echo "- [ ] Event patterns will be used" >> validation-report.md
echo "- [ ] Infrastructure components identified" >> validation-report.md
```

#### Step 4: Block Implementation if Issues Found
If any violations are detected:
- STOP implementation immediately
- Document the specific issues found
- Request clarification or adaptation guide updates
- Do NOT proceed until violations are resolved

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Setup**: Load implementation guide AND service inventory, verify dependencies
2. **PRE-IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION** (NEW):
   - Verify service inventory exists
   - Check adaptation guide mandates service reuse
   - Validate no duplication will occur
   - Confirm event patterns will be used where specified
   - BLOCK implementation if violations found
3. **Branch Verification**: Confirm NOT on main branch using `git branch --show-current`
4. **Scope Review**: Review Linear ticket requirements to establish clear boundaries
5. **Reuse-First Implementation**: 
   - Use existing services as mandated by adaptation
   - Apply existing infrastructure components
   - Integrate via events where specified
   - ONLY create new code when no alternative exists
6. **Core Implementation**: Follow guide step-by-step, implement ONLY ticket functionality
7. **Scoped Quality Assurance**: Run linting and type checking ONLY on files modified for this ticket
8. **Documentation**: Add inline comments ONLY to code created for this ticket
9. **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit ONLY ticket-related changes to feature branch
10. **Pull Request**: Create DRAFT PR with Linear ticket number in title using GitHub CLI
11. **PR Comment**: Add implementation summary as comment on the PR
12. **Linear Update**: Use `mcp__linear-server__create_comment` to add implementation completion report (do NOT change ticket status)

## Scope Control Guidelines

### MUST Implement:
- All functionality explicitly mentioned in the Linear ticket
- **MANDATORY: Reuse all services specified in adaptation guide**
- **MANDATORY: Use event patterns where specified**
- **MANDATORY: Apply existing infrastructure components**
- Error handling for the new code being added
- Basic validation for new inputs/endpoints
- **Meaningful JSDoc comments following MVD principles** (see Documentation Standards section)
- Inline comments ONLY for complex algorithms or non-obvious business logic

### MUST NOT Implement:
- **ANY functionality that exists in service inventory**
- **Custom solutions for problems already solved**
- **Direct service coupling where events are available**
- **Direct database/ORM calls outside repositories**
- **Duplicate base abstractions when one exists**
- **Config values in event payloads (only metadata)**
- Test code (handled by testing phase)
- Features not mentioned in the ticket
- Refactoring of existing code unless required for the ticket
- Fixes for pre-existing linting/type errors
- Additional "nice to have" features
- Performance optimizations beyond ticket requirements

### Quality Checks - Scoped Approach:
When running linting or type checking:
```bash
# Only check files you've modified for this ticket
git diff --name-only | xargs npm run lint
git diff --name-only | xargs npm run typecheck

# If errors appear in YOUR changes, fix them
# If errors appear in unrelated code, IGNORE them
```

## Implementation Standards

- **REUSE FIRST**: Always use existing services/infrastructure as mandated
- **Pattern Consistency**: Follow existing architectural patterns and code organization
- **Event-Driven**: Use events/messaging for cross-module communication when available
- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling ONLY for new code
- **Security**: Apply existing security infrastructure (guards, middleware, validators)
- **Performance**: Implement straightforward solutions, avoid premature optimization
- **Scope Discipline**: Stay within ticket boundaries at all times

## Documentation Standards (MVD Approach - TypeScript Aware)

### Core Principle: Document the "Why", Not the "What"
TypeScript already provides the "what" through its type system. Focus documentation on explaining complex business logic, security implications, and non-obvious design decisions.

### TypeScript Files - Minimal JSDoc (No Type Duplication)
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Redundant type information in TypeScript
/**
 * @param {string} email - User email
 * @param {string} password - User password  
 * @returns {Promise<Session>} Session object
 */
async function authenticate(email: string, password: string): Promise<Session> {}

// ✅ GOOD: Only document the "why" and complex logic
/**
 * Implements rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
 * Locks account after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.
 */
async function authenticate(email: string, password: string): Promise<Session> {}
```

### When to Add JSDoc Comments
**DOCUMENT:**
- Complex business logic that isn't self-evident
- Security implications (authentication, authorization, data sanitization)
- Non-obvious algorithmic approaches or mathematical formulas
- Workarounds for third-party bugs or browser quirks
- Side effects that aren't apparent from the function name
- Critical performance considerations

**SKIP DOCUMENTATION:**
- Simple CRUD operations
- Getters/setters without logic
- UI components without complex behavior
- Self-documenting TypeScript interfaces
- Functions where the name and parameters clearly explain the purpose

### Security-Sensitive Functions (ALWAYS Document)
```typescript
/**
 * SECURITY: Sanitizes user input to prevent XSS attacks.
 * Uses DOMPurify with strict configuration.
 */
function sanitizeHtml(input: string): string {}

/**
 * WARNING: This function handles PII data.
 * Ensure compliance with GDPR requirements.
 */
async function storeUserData(userData: UserData): Promise<void> {}
```

### Complex Algorithm Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * Uses exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd.
 * Algorithm: delay = random(0, min(cap, base * 2^attempt))
 * @see https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/
 */
function calculateRetryDelay(attempt: number): number {}
```

### Configuration & Initialization Documentation
```typescript
/**
 * SECURITY: Do not emit raw config values in events.
 * Only emit sanitized metadata or feature flags.
 */
async onModuleInit() {
  // Emit only non-sensitive data
  this.eventEmitter.emit('config.validated', { 
    featuresEnabled: this.getEnabledFeatures() 
  });
}
```

### NestJS Decorators (Let Decorators Self-Document)
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: Decorators provide the documentation
@ApiOperation({ summary: 'Create user account' })
@ApiResponse({ status: 201, type: UserDto })
@Post('users')
createUser(@Body() dto: CreateUserDto) {
  // No JSDoc needed - decorators handle API documentation
}
```

## Code Quality Requirements (Scoped to Ticket)

- **Readability**: Clear variable names in NEW code only
- **Maintainability**: Apply DRY principles to NEW code only
- **Documentation**: 
  - Meaningful JSDoc following MVD principles (see above)
  - Focus on "why" not "what" in comments
  - Security warnings for sensitive data handling
  - NO type duplication in TypeScript files
- **Security**: Validate inputs for NEW endpoints/features only
- **Scope Compliance**: Every change must directly relate to ticket requirements

## Commit and PR Process

### Committing Changes:
After implementation is complete, commit all changes to the feature branch:
```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message (use actual ticket ID from Linear)
git commit -m "feat: implement [feature description] for [TICKET-ID]

- Add [component/feature details]
- Implement [specific functionality]

```

## Success Criteria

Implementation is successful when:
- **ALL services mandated for reuse have been used**
- **NO duplication of existing functionality occurred**
- **Event patterns used where specified**
- **Infrastructure components properly reused**
- ALL ticket requirements implemented (no more, no less)
- Code follows established patterns in NEW code only
- NO test code written (deferred to testing phase)
- NO unrelated fixes or improvements made
- Linting/type checking passes for MODIFIED files only
- Minimal documentation added where necessary
- Pull request created with proper Linear ticket reference
- Linear ticket updated with implementation report INCLUDING REUSE METRICS
- Strict scope discipline maintained throughout

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### Automatic Checks
1. **Pre-commit hooks** verify no duplication patterns
2. **CI/CD pipeline** checks for service reuse compliance
3. **Code review checklist** includes duplication prevention
4. **Linear report** must include reuse metrics

### Manual Verification
1. Developer must confirm service inventory was consulted
2. Adaptation mandates must be explicitly followed
3. Any new service creation requires justification
4. Event pattern usage must be documented

The implementation phase transforms adaptation guidance into working code that fulfills EXACTLY the ticket requirements while MAXIMIZING reuse of existing services and infrastructure. Any deviation from reuse mandates is considered a critical failure requiring immediate correction.
